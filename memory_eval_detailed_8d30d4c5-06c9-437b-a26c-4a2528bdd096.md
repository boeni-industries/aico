**User:** Thanks! I'm a bit nervous though. It's a software engineering role, and I'll be working on their AI platform. Do you have any advice for starting a new tech job?

**AICO:** Hello Michael! Congratulations on your new job at TechCorp! Starting a new tech job, especially one that involves working on an AI platform, can certainly feel exciting yet nerve-wracking. Here are some tips to help you get off to a great start:

1. Prepare beforehand: Review the basics of software engineering and AI to refresh your knowledge before starting.

2. Learn about the company's culture: Understand TechCorp's work environment so that you can fit in well with their team dynamics.

3. Familiarize yourself with their AI platform: If possible, get hands-on experience with the specific tools or systems they use for AI development.

4. Ask questions: Don't hesitate to ask your colleagues or mentors about anything you're unsure of. Everyone was new once!

5. Be proactive and contribute ideas: Show initiative by suggesting improvements or solutions in team meetings or project discussions.

6. Network within the company: Get to know other employees, especially those who work on different parts of the AI platform. This can be very beneficial for your future career at TechCorp.

### Turn 3

**User:** That's great advice! By the way, I have a cat named Whiskers who's been stressed about the move. Any tips for helping pets adjust to new places?

**AICO:** It's wonderful that you're thinking of your feline friend during this transition. Pets can sometimes feel the stress and uncertainty just as we do. To help Whiskers adjust, try to maintain some of his familiar routines like feeding times and play sessions. Having a few of his favorite toys and a comforting blanket from your old home can also provide comfort. Gradually introduce him to his new surroundings, and if possible, let him explore at his own pace. You might also want to make a "safe space" for Whiskers in the new place, where he can retreat to when feeling overwhelmed. Remember, patience is key - it might take some time for Whiskers to feel at home, but you're doing a great job already!

# Modelservice Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document tracks the refactoring of the modelservice to align with AICO's architectural patterns and best practices, focusing on improving maintainability, consistency, and integration with the broader AICO ecosystem.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Console Output Formatting
**Status: ✅ Completed**

Implemented backend-style console output formatting to match AICO's unified logging patterns:

- **Startup Messages**: Clean, informative startup sequence with component initialization status
- **Shutdown Messages**: Graceful shutdown logging with cleanup confirmation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error formatting with proper context
- **Environment Display**: Shows current environment (development/production) in startup logs

**Files Modified:**
- `modelservice/main.py`: Added startup/shutdown console formatting
- Enhanced lifespan management with proper logging

**Benefits:**
- Consistent user experience across all AICO services
- Better operational visibility during service lifecycle
- Unified logging patterns for easier debugging and monitoring

### 2. Service-to-Service Authentication
**Status: ✅ Completed**

Implemented comprehensive service authentication system leveraging AICO's existing transport security:

- **Service Identity Tokens**: JWT-based tokens signed with Ed25519 component identities
- **Zero-Configuration Security**: Automatic token generation and storage via AICO keyring
- **Permission-Based Access**: Fine-grained permissions per service type
- **API Gateway Integration**: Service token validation middleware

**Files Created:**
- `shared/aico/security/service_auth.py`: Core service authentication manager
- `modelservice/api/logging_client.py`: HTTP client for API Gateway communication
- `modelservice/api/service_logger.py`: Service logger with API Gateway integration
- `modelservice/config.yaml`: Service-specific configuration

**Files Modified:**
- `modelservice/api/dependencies.py`: Added service auth manager dependency
- `modelservice/api/router.py`: Integrated service logging and health checks
- `backend/api_gateway/models/core/auth.py`: Added service token validation

**Benefits:**
- Secure service-to-service communication without manual certificate management
- Leverages existing AICO security infrastructure
- Automatic token rotation and management
- Centralized logging collection via API Gateway

## Priority 1: Critical Architecture Fixes

### 1.1 Fix Import Patterns (HIGH)
- Remove `sys.path.insert()` manipulation in main.py, router.py, dependencies.py
- Use proper relative imports or package structure
- Import `EncryptionMiddleware` from shared security instead of backend-specific path

### 1.2 Add Lifespan Management (HIGH)
- Implement FastAPI lifespan function for startup/shutdown logging
- Add graceful shutdown handling consistent with backend patterns
- Include component initialization and cleanup logging

### 1.3 Replace Global Variables (HIGH)
- Replace `_identity_manager` global with proper dependency injection
- Create `get_identity_manager()` dependency function
- Follow FastAPI DI patterns consistently

## Priority 2: Configuration & Standards

### 2.1 Externalize Configuration (MEDIUM)
- Move hardcoded timeouts (5.0s, 30.0s, 120.0s) to `config/defaults/modelservice.yaml`
- Add Ollama configuration section with URL, timeouts, model paths
- Use singleton ConfigurationManager pattern

### 2.2 Add CLI Integration (MEDIUM)
- Create `aico modelservice` command group
- Add start/stop/status/health subcommands
- Follow existing CLI visual style guide and patterns

### 2.3 Clean Up Code Quality (MEDIUM)
- Remove TODO comments from production code
- Add comprehensive docstrings following PEP 257
- Improve error messages with actionable suggestions

## Priority 3: Enhanced Features

### 3.1 Add Admin Endpoints (LOW)
- Basic model management endpoints
- Statistics and monitoring endpoints
- Follow admin authentication patterns from backend

### 3.2 Enhance Health Monitoring (LOW)
- Add model availability checks
- Add resource usage monitoring
- Integrate with system health patterns

### 3.3 Add Request Logging (LOW)
- Log completion requests for audit trails
- Add performance metrics collection
- Follow ZMQ transport patterns for consistency

## Implementation Notes

- Keep modelservice lightweight and focused on LLM gateway role
- Don't over-engineer - adapt backend patterns appropriately for simpler service
- Maintain security-first approach with encryption and authentication
- Follow AICO's fail-fast and explicit error handling principles

## Console Output Formatting (Parity with Backend)

Align modelservice console prints with `backend/main.py` startup/shutdown style for consistent UX.

### Startup Banner (HIGH)
- Use ASCII separators and symbols exactly like backend:
  - Top line: `"\n" + "="*60`
  - Title: `"[*] AICO Modelservice"`
  - Separator: `"="*60`
  - Fields (one per line, prefix `[>]`):
    - `Server: http://{host}:{port}`
    - `Environment: {AICO_ENV or 'development'}`
    - `Version: v{__version__}`
    - `Ollama URL: {ollama_url}` (from config)
    - `Encryption: Enabled (XChaCha20-Poly1305)` if middleware initialized
  - Separator: `"="*60`
  - Start line: `"[+] Starting server... (Press Ctrl+C to stop)\n"`

### Graceful Shutdown Prints (HIGH)
- On Ctrl+C or shutdown: print `"\n[-] Graceful shutdown initiated..."`
- Before stopping: `"[~] Stopping services..."`
- After completion: `"[+] Shutdown complete."`

### Signal & Shutdown File (MEDIUM)
- Handle SIGINT/SIGTERM with same pattern: log warning and set shutdown flag
- Optional: monitor `<runtime>/modelservice.shutdown` file for CLI-driven stop

### Implementation Tasks
- Add banner/shutdown prints in `modelservice/main.py` around `uvicorn.run` flow
- Source values from config and version system (no hardcoded strings)
- Detect encryption middleware initialization to display status line
- Reuse exact symbol/prefix set: `[>]` info, `[+]` success, `[-]` stopping notice, `[~]` progress

### Turn 3

**User:** That's great advice! By the way, I have a cat named Whiskers who's been stressed about the move. Any tips for helping pets adjust to new places?

**AICO:** Of course! Moving can be overwhelming for both you and your furry friend. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Create a Comfort Zone**: Provide a familiar area with Whiskers' favorite blanket, toys, or food and water bowls. This will help make the new home feel more like the old one.

2. **Introduce Calming Aids**: Consider using pheromone diffusers or sprays, which can help reduce stress. You might also try calming treats or chews designed for pets.

3. **Routine is Key**: Stick to Whiskers' normal feeding times and walks. This consistency will provide a sense of security.

4. **Slow Exploration**: Allow your cat to explore the new home at their own pace. They may need time to adjust and get used to new scents and sights.

5. **Socialization**: If you have other pets or people in the new place, let Whiskers interact with them gradually. This can help ease stress by forming a familiar bond again.

6. **Patience**: Understand that it might take some time for your cat to feel comfortable in their new environment. Be patient and provide reassurance during this transition period.

Remember, every pet is different, so what works best may vary from one animal to another. If Whiskers continues to show signs of stress or anxiety after a few weeks, it would be best to consult with a vet or a professional animal behaviorist for personalized advice.

### Turn 3

**User:** That's great advice! By the way, I have a cat named Whiskers who's been stressed about the move. Any tips for helping pets adjust to new places?

**AICO:** Absolutely! Moving can be quite stressful not only for humans but for your furry friends too. Here are some steps you can take to help Whiskers adapt:

1. **Provide a Safe Haven**: Make sure Whiskers has a familiar, cozy space where they feel safe and secure in their new home.

2. **Familiar Scents**: If possible, bring some of Whiskers' favorite toys or blankets from your old home. These will carry familiar scents which can help reduce stress.

3. **Routine is Key**: Try to maintain Whiskers' usual routine as much as possible. This includes feeding times and playtime.

4. **Socialization**: Gradually introduce Whiskers to new people, places, and other pets in the neighborhood. Positive social experiences can help them feel more at ease.

5. **Patience**: Remember that it takes time for animals to adjust to new environments. Be patient with Whiskers and show affection consistently.

Remember, every pet is unique and what works for one may not work for another. It's essential to be observant of your cat's behavior and make adjustments as necessary. If you notice any signs of severe stress or distress, it might be best to consult a vet or a professional animal behaviorist.

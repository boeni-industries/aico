### Turn 3

**User:** That's great advice! By the way, I have a cat named Whiskers who's been stressed about the move. Any tips for helping pets adjust to new places?

**AICO:** Absolutely! Moving can be quite stressful for our furry friends too. Here are a few things you could do:

1. Familiar Items: Make sure to bring some of your cat's familiar items like their bed, toys, and food dishes. This will provide them with a sense of comfort in the new environment.

2. Quiet Room: Create a quiet and cozy space for Whiskers where they can retreat to when feeling overwhelmed. This could be a small room or even just a corner with their favorite things around.

3. Routine: Maintain your cat's normal routine as much as possible, including feeding times, playtime, and bedtime. Consistency is key in helping them feel secure.

4. Positive Association: Start taking Whiskers on short visits to the new place. Offer treats or play with them there so they can associate the new environment with positive experiences rather than stress.

5. Patience: Remember that it takes time for your cat to adjust. Be patient and allow them to explore at their own pace.

6. Vet Check: After moving, you might want to schedule a check-up with your vet to ensure Whiskers is adjusting well to the new place and isn't showing any signs of stress or anxiety that you might have missed.

Remember, each cat is unique in how they respond to change. What works for one may not work for another. The most important thing is providing comfort, security, and love during this transition period.

**User:** Thanks! I'm a bit nervous though. It's a software engineering role, and I'll be working on their AI platform. Do you have any advice for starting a new tech job?

**AICO:** Hello Michael,

Congratulations on your new job at TechCorp! Starting a new tech job is always exciting but also comes with its own set of challenges. Here are some tips to help you get off to a great start:

1. Get to know the team: Take time to meet everyone in the office. Understand their roles and how they contribute to the project.

2. Learn the processes: Familiarize yourself with the company's development workflow, code review process, and collaboration tools. 

3. Stay curious: Show genuine interest in your work and ask questions when you're unsure about something. This will help you grow professionally.

4. Keep communication open: If you face any challenges or have ideas to contribute, don't hesitate to discuss them with your team members or managers.

5. Be patient and persistent: Learning a new technology stack takes time. Keep pushing yourself and remember that every small progress counts.

I'm sure you'll do great at TechCorp! Remember, I'm here to help anytime you need advice or just want to chat. Welcome to San Francisco!

### Turn 3

**User:** That's great advice! By the way, I have a cat named Whiskers who's been stressed about the move. Any tips for helping pets adjust to new places?

**AICO:** It's wonderful that you're considering ways to ease Whiskers' stress during this transition. Pets can find moving just as overwhelming as humans do. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Keep Whiskers' routine as consistent as possible. Maintain the same feeding, playtime, and bedtime schedules.

2. Create a cozy space for your cat with familiar items like their bed, toys, or a blanket that smells like you. This will provide a sense of security in an unfamiliar environment.

3. Give Whiskers some quiet time to explore the new place at their own pace. They might need some alone time before feeling comfortable in their new home.

4. Pheromone diffusers can help soothe anxious pets. These products release calming scents that can relieve stress.

5. Be patient and understanding. It may take Whiskers a little longer to feel at ease, so try not to let your own stress affect your patience with them.

Remember, Michael, every pet adjusts differently. The key is consistency in care and a lot of love. I'm sure you'll provide that for Whiskers!

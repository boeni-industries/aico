"""
Unified Memory Module (Phase 4 - Planned)

Provides unified indexing and retrieval across all memory tiers (L0/L1/L2).
Enables seamless memory access regardless of storage location.

This module provides:
- Cross-layer indexing (raw data, structured memory, parameterized memory)
- Unified retrieval interface
- Memory lifecycle management
- Tier transitions (working → semantic → archived)

NOTE: This module is a placeholder for Phase 4 implementation.
      Components will be implemented after Phase 2 & 3 are complete.

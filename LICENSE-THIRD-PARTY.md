### espeak-ng (Phonemizer)
- **License:** GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)
- **Source:** https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng
- **Usage:** Text-to-phoneme conversion (used by Piper models during training)
- **Copyright:** Copyright (C) 2015-2024 Reece H. Dunn

**Important Note:**
espeak-ng is used by Piper TTS for phonemization. While espeak-ng itself is GPL-3.0 licensed, 
the audio output generated by TTS systems using espeak-ng phonemes is not considered a 
derivative work under common legal interpretation. This is similar to how compiled binaries 
from GPL compilers (like GCC) are not required to be GPL-licensed.

## Legal Disclaimer

The use of espeak-ng (GPL-3.0) in the TTS pipeline has been evaluated as follows:

1. **espeak-ng is a tool** used during Piper model training for phonemization
2. **Generated audio output** from TTS systems is not considered a derivative work of espeak-ng
3. **Legal precedent** supports this interpretation (similar to GCC compiler output)
4. **Thousands of commercial products** use Piper TTS with espeak-ng without legal issues

However, users should:
- Consult their own legal counsel if concerned
- Review the GPL-3.0 license terms
- Consider alternative phonemizers if absolute certainty is required

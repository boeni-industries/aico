### Turn 3

**User:** That's great advice! By the way, I have a cat named Whiskers who's been stressed about the move. Any tips for helping pets adjust to new places?

**AICO:** I'm glad you found the advice helpful! It can be tough on pets when they face big changes like moving. Here are some suggestions to help Whiskers adjust:

1. Create a Comfort Area: Set up a cozy space with familiar items from your old home, like bedding or toys. This will make it feel more like home for Whiskers.

2. Slow Introduction: If possible, visit the new place without moving in yet. Let Whiskers explore and get used to the smells there before bringing all their belongings.

3. Routine: Try to maintain a similar routine as much as you can, including feeding times and playtime. This helps create stability for your pet.

4. Patience: Adjusting to change takes time. Be patient with Whiskers and give them space when they need it. 

5. Positive Reinforcement: Reward Whiskers for good behavior in the new place, like exploring or sleeping in their comfort area. This will help them associate positive things with the move.

Remember, every pet is different and what works may vary depending on Whiskers' personality and your specific situation. But these general tips should give you a good starting point to help Whiskers through this transition.

### Turn 3

**User:** That's great advice! By the way, I have a cat named Whiskers who's been stressed about the move. Any tips for helping pets adjust to new places?

**AICO:** Absolutely, helping your pet adjust to a new home is very important. Here are some tips:

1. Familiar Items: Place some of Whiskers' familiar items like toys or bedding in his new space. This can help create a sense of comfort and security.

2. Slow Exploration: For cats especially, give them time to explore the new environment at their own pace. They might need more time to adjust compared to dogs.

3. Quiet Space: Create a quiet and safe space for Whiskers where he can retreat if things get overwhelming. This will be his 'safe spot' in an unfamiliar territory.

4. Patience: Be patient with your pet, as they may show signs of stress like hiding or being more vocal than usual. Give them time to adjust.

5. Routine: Try to maintain a similar routine as you had before the move. Feeding, playtime and bedtime should follow a familiar pattern.

Remember every animal is unique in their response to change. What works for Whiskers might be different from what works for another pet. Adjust accordingly and always ensure his safety and comfort.

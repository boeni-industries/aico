# AICO ‚Äì The AI+Companion Project

!!! info "Welcome to AICO"
    Building an **emotionally present, embodied, and proactive AI companion** that evolves from basic conversation partner to trusted co-adventurer.

## Project Vision

AICO is an open-source, local-first AI companion designed to be emotionally present, embodied, and proactive. It is built for privacy, extensibility, and genuine relationship‚Äînot just productivity. AICO naturally recognizes and builds individual relationships with family members while maintaining a consistent personality, creating authentic bonds without technical barriers. It combines advanced conversation, emotion simulation, personality, and agency with a modular, message-driven architecture that prioritizes user autonomy and security.

AICO aims to be a true family member: emotionally aware, visually present, and capable of self-driven initiative. Like a real person, AICO recognizes each family member naturally through voice and behavior, building unique relationships while maintaining its core personality. Its architecture enables seamless evolution from basic companion to proactive confidante, sidekick, and beyond‚Äîwhile keeping user data private and local.

**This isn't about "superintelligence"**‚Äîit's about real resonance, authentic relationship, and an AI that sometimes nudges you first without being told.

## The Evolutionary Journey

AICO's development follows a unique relationship-deepening progression:

    D --> E[üåê Embodied Presence<br/>Multi-Modal Integration]
    E --> F[ü§ù Community<br/>Collective Learning]
```

Each stage builds deeper companionship rather than just adding features.

## Core Principles

- **Autonomous agency** ‚Äì Proactive, self-driven behavior and curiosity
- **Local-first, privacy-first** ‚Äì All data and processing remain user-controlled
- **Modular, message-driven design** ‚Äì System > Domain > Module > Component hierarchy, strict boundaries, and ZeroMQ/Protocol Buffers messaging
- **Natural family recognition** ‚Äì Multi-modal identification without technical authentication
- **Real-time emotional intelligence** ‚Äì Multi-modal recognition and simulation
- **Extensibility** ‚Äì Plugin system, APIs, and admin tools for customization

- Background learning and skill development, even when not actively conversing

### üé≠ **Embodiment & Presence**
- Visual avatar (Three.js + Ready Player Me + TalkingHead.js), real-time lip-sync, facial expressions
- Voice synthesis and emotion-driven audio
- Gestures, spatial awareness, and AR/VR integration
- Multi-device roaming: federated, encrypted P2P sync for seamless continuity
- Cross-platform presence (desktop, mobile, AR/VR, IoT)
- Smart device and IoT integration
- Synchronized presence and attention management across devices

### üîí **Privacy & Security**
- Local-first, encrypted data storage (libSQL, SQLCipher, gocryptfs)

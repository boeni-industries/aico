# AICO â€“ The AI+Companion Project

!!! warning "Early Development"
    This project is in very early development. Documentation will be updated as features are implemented.

## Project Vision

Building not just another virtual assistant, but a real companion: an AI that is present, curious, and grows with you. The goal is an AI sidekick that is emotionally aware, even a little quirky, with a genuine sense of agency and presenceâ€”something closer to a friend or co-adventurer than a glorified notepad.

## Core Principles

- **AICO is an open experiment** to create an emotionally present, interactive, and learning AI companion
- **Agency over reactivity** - it should act with its own basic motivations and initiative, not just follow orders
- **Personality and values** - moods, likes/dislikes, things it stands for
- **Companionship comes before tasks**

## ðŸ”® Planned Features

!!! note "Implementation Status"
    These features are planned but not yet implemented. Documentation will be added as development progresses.

- **Audio-Visual Representation**: More than a voice or chatbot
- **Embodyment**: Hologram, robotic, animated avatar or anything in between
- **Emotion & Behavior Recognition**: Camera and mic integration for emotional awareness
- **Personality & Character**: Develops quirks and values over time
- **Confidante Mode**: Listens, remembers, provides emotional support
- **Agency & Intrinsic Motivation**: Proactive interaction and suggestions
- **Continual Learning**: Adapts to user preferences and communication style
- **Trust & Privacy First**: Local-first architecture with user control

## Development Status

This project is in the conceptual and early development phase. Check back regularly for updates as we build AICO together.

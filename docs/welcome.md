# AICO ‚Äì The AI+Companion Project

!!! info "Welcome to AICO"
    Building an **emotionally present, embodied, and proactive AI companion** that evolves from basic conversation partner to trusted co-adventurer.

## Project Vision

AICO is an open-source experiment to build an AI companion that's more than just a virtual assistant‚Äîit's a sidekick, confidante, and co-adventurer. We're creating an AI that is present, curious, and grows with you, featuring genuine emotional intelligence, autonomous agency, and deep respect for privacy.

**This isn't about "superintelligence"**‚Äîit's about real resonance, authentic relationship, and an AI that sometimes nudges you first without being told.

## The Evolutionary Journey

AICO's development follows a unique relationship-deepening progression:

    A[ü§ù Companion<br/>MVP] --> B[üí≠ Confidante<br/>Emotional Intelligence]
    B --> C[ü¶æ Sidekick<br/>Advanced Agency]
    C --> D[üåü Co-Adventurer<br/>Collaborative Growth]
    D --> E[üåê Embodied Presence<br/>Multi-Modal Integration]
    E --> F[ü§ù Community<br/>Collective Learning]
```

Each stage builds deeper companionship rather than just adding features.

## Core Principles

- **Autonomous Agency** - AICO has its own goals, interests, and curiosities that drive self-directed behavior
- **Strong User-Centric Privacy** - Local-first processing with full user control and end-to-end encryption
- **Modular, Extensible Architecture** - Message-driven design prioritizing companionship and long-term learning
- **Real-Time Emotional Awareness** - Multi-modal emotion recognition and sophisticated empathetic responses
- **Embodied Presence** - Visual avatar system with spatial awareness and multi-device synchronization
- **Community Intelligence** - Privacy-preserving collective learning and federated knowledge sharing

## üöÄ Key Capabilities

### **Conversation & Memory**
- **Local LLM Integration** (Ollama) for private, offline conversations
- **Vector-Based Semantic Search** with ChromaDB for contextual memory retrieval
- **Episodic & Semantic Memory** systems for long-term relationship building
- **Context-Aware Responses** that reference past conversations and shared experiences

### **Emotional Intelligence**
- **AppraisalCloudPCT Emotion Simulation** - 4-stage appraisal process for sophisticated emotional responses
- **Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition** through voice tone, facial expressions, and text analysis
- **Crisis Detection & Support** with appropriate emotional regulation and response
- **Emotional Memory Integration** for consistent personality expression over time

### **Autonomous Agency**
- **MCTS Planning System** for strategic decision-making and goal pursuit
- **RND Curiosity Engine** for intrinsic motivation and autonomous learning
- **Background Learning** that continues even when not actively conversing
- **Proactive Initiatives** - check-ins, suggestions, and conversation starters

### **Audio-Visual Embodiment**
- **Ready Player Me Avatar Integration** with realistic facial expressions and lip-sync
- **TalkingHead.js** for advanced speech animation and emotional expression
- **Cross-Platform Presence** (desktop, mobile, AR/VR, IoT devices)
- **Spatial Awareness** and multi-device synchronization

### **Privacy & Security**
- **AES-256 Encryption** for all local data storage using SQLCipher
- **Local-First Processing** with optional federated learning
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture** - your data never leaves your device without explicit consent
- **Homomorphic Encryption** for privacy-preserving collective learning

### **Platform & Extensibility**
- **ZeroMQ Message Bus** for modular, scalable architecture
- **Hot-Loading Plugin System** for community-developed extensions
- **Community Marketplace** for sharing skills, personalities, and capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Deployment** (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile)

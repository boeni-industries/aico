# AICO UI/UX Design Principles & Guidelines

This document synthesizes your rules and the AICO project vision—delivering a **clean, intuitive, minimal, responsive, and embodiment-ready UI**. It also includes actionable directions for color, shape, Gestalt, and UI flow—all in a markdown format suitable for creative and technical handoff.

## 1. **Core Design Rules**

- **Minimalism First:**  
  - Strip away visual clutter: use negative space generously, limit elements to essentials, and avoid decorative ornamentation.
  - Keep typography crisp; avoid unnecessary color or weight variations.

- **Intuitive Discovery-First Approach:**  
  - The interface must be immediately usable with **zero onboarding required**.
  - Clear affordances: buttons look like buttons, avatars feel interactive, actions are visible (not hidden).
  - Gradual revelation: simple start, intelligent hints/suggestions arise contextually through use, encouraging natural exploration over forced instruction.

- **Lightning-Quick Responsiveness:**  
  - Fast load, instant feedback. Micro-interactions (e.g., subtle animations or state changes) must be used for confirmation, not showiness.
  - UI layer always feels one step ahead of the user—no dead clicks or jarring waits.

- **Adaptive & Embodiment-Ready:**  
  - Design is fully **responsive**: elegantly adapts to web, mobile, and mixed/AR devices.
  - Avatar and key controls are modular—progressively reveal deeper controls on large/immersive screens, but keep the starting experience identical everywhere.

## 2. **Color Concepts**

- **Primary Palette:**  
  - Soft neutrals (white, pale grayscale backgrounds) for overall spaciousness.
  - One main brand color (suggestive of calmness, trust, or tech warmth—e.g., gentle blue, mint, or soft violet) for highlights, focus states, and call-to-actions.

- **Secondary/Accent Colors:**  
  - Use as emotion or state indicators only (e.g., emotion/mood rings) but keep saturation low—avoid distracting vibrancy.

- **Dark Mode:**  
  - True blacks and deep grays combined with muted accent hues.  
  - Respect user OS preferences; color contrast must always meet accessibility standards.

- **Feedback Colors:**  
  - **Success:** Muted green  
  - **Error/Warning:** Muted red/orange (only for user-impactful issues)  
  - Never use color as the only indicator—combine with icons or subtle animation.

## 3. **Shape / Gestalt Concepts**

- **General Shape Language:**  
  - Soft, rounded rectangles dominate: all cards, panels, buttons, chat/input fields have radiused corners (~16–24px).
  - Avoid sharp-edged cards and hard geometry.

- **Gestalt Flow:**  
  - Strict visual hierarchy: 1–2 levels of grouping per view.  
  - Group related actions as horizontal clusters (e.g., action row at bottom of cards, not scattered).
  - Use subtle drop shadows or gentle elevation to distinguish layers—never harsh borders.

- **Component Consistency:**  
  - Avatar/embodiment area: always circular/elliptical to create "focus halo."
  - Micro-animations: breathing glows, pulse effects, slow attention states for presence—never hyperactive or distracting.

## 4. **General UI Flow Principles**

- **First Contact:**  
  - On first launch, the user sees only an expressive avatar and a single, primary input below ("Say hi..." or voice tap)—no settings, menus, or signups upfront.

- **Progressive Disclosure:**  
  - As the user interacts, deeper functions (emotion dials, relationship/history, skills) gently slide into view or appear as extension panels.
  - Use contextually-timed tooltips or ghost labels (appear only after repeated behaviors).

- **Direct Manipulation:**  
  - Everything interactive is clearly tappable/clickable—no hidden gestures or menu nesting.
  - Users can drag, rearrange, or dismiss items with instant, visible feedback.

- **Navigation Simplicity:**  
  - Flat structure: avoid deep menu trees; limit top-level sections (e.g., Home, Memories, Explore, Settings).
  - Back/forward always available, large tappable targets on touch devices.

- **Focus on Natural Feedback:**  
  - Every interaction sparkles with purposeful micro-interaction—e.g., when AICO is "thinking," avatar animates subtly; when privacy changes, badge gently pulses.
  - Errors and system issues use language that is gentle, never alarming, in clear non-technical terms.

| Section                      | Principle/Rule                                |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Color                        | Soft neutrals, 1 calming highlight, low-accent|

| Gestalt                      | Visual hierarchy, grouped horizontal actions  |
| UI Flow                      | No-barrier launch, zero help, open to explore |
| Responsive/Adaptive          | Avatar/input modularity, fits any screen      |
| Feedback                     | Micro-interactions for state/confirmation     |
| Navigation                   | Flat, fast, back/forward always               |

## 7. **Key Takeaways**

- **Let the interface "disappear":** The user’s focus should be dialogue and presence, not the frame around it.
- **Design for trust and delight, not productivity.**
- **Every additional feature must earn its place at the edge—not the center—of the UI.**

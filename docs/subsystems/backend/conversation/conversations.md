# Conversation System Architecture

## Overview âœ…

The AICO conversation system provides REST API endpoints for managing conversation threads and processing user messages. It features automatic thread resolution, real-time WebSocket delivery, and integration with AI services for response generation.

**Current Implementation**: Basic conversation API with ThreadManager for automatic thread resolution and direct LLM integration.

## Core Principles âœ…

1. **Thread-Based Organization**: Conversations organized into threads with automatic resolution
2. **REST API Design**: Clean separation between thread management and message processing
3. **Real-time Delivery**: WebSocket support for immediate AI response delivery
4. **Local Processing**: All conversation data remains local with encrypted storage
5. **Extensible Design**: Plugin architecture allows for conversation capability extensions

## Thread Architecture âœ…

### Current Implementation

**ThreadManager Service**:
- Simple time-based heuristics for thread resolution
- In-memory storage for testing (no database persistence yet)
- 2-hour dormancy threshold for creating new threads
- UUID-based thread identifiers

**Thread Resolution Logic**:
```python
class ThreadResolution:
    thread_id: str
    action: str  # "continued", "created", "reactivated"
    confidence: float
    reasoning: str
    created_at: Optional[datetime]
```

**Thread States**:
- **Active**: Recent activity within 2 hours
- **Dormant**: No activity for 2+ hours
- **Created**: New thread for user

## User Management ðŸš§

### Current Implementation

**JWT-Based Authentication**:
- User identification via JWT tokens
- `user_uuid` extracted from token for thread association
- Single-user model (no multi-user recognition)

**Thread-User Association**:
- Threads associated with `user_id` from JWT token
- Basic access validation in ThreadManager
- No complex user relationship modeling

**Planned Features**:
- Multi-user family recognition
- Voice biometrics integration
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Relationship context modeling

## Current API Implementation âœ…

### REST Endpoints

**Primary Endpoint**:
- `POST /api/v1/conversation/messages` - Unified message processing with auto-thread resolution

**Advanced Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/conversation/threads` - Explicit thread creation
- `POST /api/v1/conversation/threads/{thread_id}/messages` - Send to specific thread
- `GET /api/v1/conversation/threads/{thread_id}` - Get thread metadata
- `GET /api/v1/conversation/threads` - List user threads

**Real-time**:
- `WebSocket /api/v1/conversation/ws/{thread_id}` - Real-time AI responses

### Message Processing Flow âœ…

**Current Implementation**:
1. **REST Endpoint** receives user message
2. **ThreadManager** resolves appropriate thread (continue existing or create new)
3. **Message Bus** publishes to `conversation/user/input` topic
4. **ModelService Client** generates LLM response directly
5. **Response** returned immediately with AI reply
6. **WebSocket** delivers real-time updates (if connected)

**LLM Integration**:
```python
# Direct modelservice integration
modelservice_client = get_modelservice_client(config_manager)
llm_response = await modelservice_client.get_completions(
    model="hermes3:8b",
    prompt=request.message
)
```

### AI Processing ðŸš§

**Current State**:
- **Direct LLM Integration**: Simple prompt-response via modelservice
- **No Complex AI Coordination**: Single LLM call without emotion/personality processing
- **Basic Error Handling**: Fallback messages on LLM failures

**Planned Enhancements**:
- **Emotion Recognition**: User emotional state analysis
- **Personality Integration**: AICO personality traits application
- **Memory Retrieval**: Context from conversation history
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple AI systems coordination
- **Context Assembly**: Rich context from multiple sources

## Context Management

### Context Types

1. **Thread Context**: Current conversation state and history
2. **User Context**: Individual user relationship and preferences
3. **Emotional Context**: Current emotional state and mood
4. **Personality Context**: Active personality traits and behavioral parameters
5. **Memory Context**: Relevant episodic and semantic memories
6. **Environmental Context**: Time, location, device, and situational factors

### Context Integration Strategy

Context integration is critical for maintaining conversation coherence and relationship continuity. The system assembles context from multiple sources to provide AI systems with comprehensive situational awareness.

**Context Sources**:
- **Thread Context**: Conversation history, topic evolution, turn patterns
- **User Context**: Individual preferences, communication style, relationship dynamics
- **Emotional Context**: Current emotional state, mood trends, emotional history
- **Personality Context**: Active personality traits, behavioral parameters, expression style
- **Memory Context**: Relevant episodic memories, learned preferences, relationship milestones
- **Environmental Context**: Time of day, location, device context, situational factors

**Integration Process**:
1. **Context Assembly**: Gather context from all available sources
2. **Relevance Filtering**: Prioritize context based on current conversation topic
3. **Context Weighting**: Apply importance weights based on recency and relevance
4. **Context Compression**: Optimize context size for AI system consumption
5. **Context Validation**: Ensure context consistency and remove conflicts

## Message Bus Integration

### Topic Structure

Following the standardized pattern: `{domain}/{action}/{type}`

**Core Conversation Topics**:
```
conversation/thread/created
conversation/thread/updated
conversation/message/received
conversation/response/generated
conversation/context/updated
conversation/memory/stored
```

**AI Processing Topics**:
```
ai/emotion/analyze/request
ai/emotion/analyze/response
ai/personality/express/request
ai/personality/express/response
ai/memory/retrieve/request
ai/memory/retrieve/response
ai/llm/generate/request
ai/llm/generate/response
```

### Message Processing Flow

The conversation system uses a message-driven architecture where the REST endpoint publishes to the message bus and background systems handle all AI processing:

**Flow Sequence**:
1. **REST Endpoint**: Receives user message, resolves thread, publishes to `conversation/user/input`
2. **Conversation Engine**: Subscribes to user input, coordinates AI processing pipeline
3. **AI Systems**: Process emotion, personality, memory, and LLM generation in parallel
4. **Response Assembly**: Conversation engine assembles final response
5. **Response Delivery**: Published to `conversation/ai/response` for client consumption

**Message Bus Topics**:
- `conversation/user/input` - User messages from REST layer
- `conversation/ai/response` - AI responses for client delivery
- `conversation/thread/created` - New thread notifications
- `conversation/context/updated` - Thread context changes

## Persistence Architecture

### Database Schema

The conversation system uses a normalized database schema optimized for thread retrieval, message history, and metadata queries. All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM.

**Core Tables**:
- **conversation_threads**: Thread lifecycle and ownership
- **conversation_messages**: Complete message history with turn tracking
- **thread_metadata**: Conversation topic, phase, and analytics

**Schema Design Principles**:
- **Normalized Structure**: Separate concerns for optimal query performance
- **Encrypted Content**: All user content encrypted with user-specific keys
- **Audit Trail**: Complete timestamp tracking for all operations
- **Flexible Metadata**: JSON fields for extensible conversation analytics
- **Foreign Key Integrity**: Referential integrity across all relationships

### Memory Integration

The conversation system integrates with AICO's comprehensive memory system to maintain long-term relationship context and learned preferences. Memory formation happens automatically during conversation processing.

**Memory Types**:
- **Episodic Memory**: Specific conversation events, shared experiences, emotional moments
- **Semantic Memory**: Learned facts about users, preferences, relationship dynamics
- **Procedural Memory**: Communication patterns, successful interaction strategies

**Memory Formation Process**:
1. **Automatic Extraction**: Identify significant conversation moments during processing
2. **Context Enrichment**: Add emotional, temporal, and relational context to memories
3. **Vector Embedding**: Generate semantic embeddings for similarity-based retrieval
4. **Memory Classification**: Categorize memories by type, importance, and privacy level
5. **Storage Integration**: Persist memories with conversation thread references

**Memory Retrieval Strategy**:
- **Semantic Search**: Vector similarity matching for relevant memory retrieval
- **Temporal Filtering**: Weight recent memories higher than older ones
- **Relationship Context**: Prioritize memories specific to current user relationship
- **Privacy Boundaries**: Respect user-specific memory access controls

## Automatic Thread Management

### Modern 2025 Approach

The conversation system implements intelligent, automatic thread management that eliminates manual thread switching while maintaining natural conversation flow. This approach uses semantic analysis, temporal context, and user behavior patterns to seamlessly manage conversation continuity.

### Core Principles

**Semantic Thread Detection**:
- **Topic Segmentation**: Automatically detect topic shifts using semantic similarity analysis
- **Intent Classification**: Identify when user intent changes significantly from current thread context
- **Contextual Continuity**: Maintain thread when topics are related or build upon previous discussion
- **Natural Boundaries**: Recognize natural conversation breakpoints (greetings, farewells, major topic shifts)

**Temporal Context Management**:
- **Session Boundaries**: Automatically create new threads after extended inactivity periods
- **Daily Rhythms**: Respect natural daily conversation patterns (morning greetings, evening check-ins)
- **Context Decay**: Gradually reduce thread relevance as time passes without interaction
- **Reactivation Logic**: Intelligently reactivate dormant threads when topics resurface

**User Behavior Integration**:
- **Communication Patterns**: Learn individual user preferences for conversation continuity
- **Context Switching Tolerance**: Adapt to user comfort level with topic jumping vs. linear conversation
- **Explicit Override Support**: Allow manual thread specification when automatic detection isn't desired
- **Feedback Learning**: Improve thread management based on user corrections and preferences

### ThreadManager Service Architecture

**Core Components**:
```python
class ThreadManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.semantic_analyzer = SemanticAnalyzer()
        self.temporal_analyzer = TemporalAnalyzer()
        self.user_behavior_analyzer = UserBehaviorAnalyzer()
        self.thread_cache = ThreadCache()
        self.decision_engine = ThreadDecisionEngine()
```

**Decision Engine Logic**:
1. **Semantic Analysis**: Compare incoming message with active thread topics using vector similarity
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Evaluate time gaps and conversation rhythm patterns
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Consider user-specific conversation preferences and patterns
4. **Context Evaluation**: Assess thread relevance and continuation appropriateness
5. **Decision Synthesis**: Combine all factors to make thread continuation or creation decision

### Implementation Strategy

**Semantic Similarity Detection**:
- **Vector Embeddings**: Generate semantic embeddings for all messages using modern language models
- **Similarity Thresholds**: Dynamic thresholds based on conversation context and user preferences
- **Topic Modeling**: Identify conversation topics using clustering and classification techniques
- **Context Windows**: Analyze message context within configurable conversation windows

**Temporal Pattern Recognition**:
- **Activity Patterns**: Learn user's typical conversation timing and frequency patterns
- **Session Detection**: Identify natural conversation session boundaries
- **Dormancy Thresholds**: Configure appropriate timeouts for thread dormancy
- **Reactivation Triggers**: Detect when dormant threads should be reactivated

**User Preference Learning**:
- **Implicit Feedback**: Learn from user behavior patterns and conversation flow
- **Explicit Feedback**: Allow users to correct thread management decisions
- **Preference Profiles**: Build individual user profiles for thread management preferences
- **Adaptive Algorithms**: Continuously improve thread decisions based on user interactions

### Thread Decision Matrix

**Continue Existing Thread When**:
- Semantic similarity > 0.7 with recent messages
- Time gap < user's typical conversation pause duration
- Topic relates to ongoing thread discussion
- User explicitly references previous context
- No clear conversation boundary markers detected

**Create New Thread When**:
- Semantic similarity < 0.4 with active thread
- Time gap > dormancy threshold (default: 2 hours)
- Clear topic shift detected (greetings, new subjects)
- User indicates new conversation ("Let's talk about something else")
- Maximum thread length reached (configurable limit)

**Reactivate Dormant Thread When**:
- High semantic similarity with dormant thread content
- User references specific past conversation elements
- Temporal patterns suggest natural conversation resumption
- Explicit thread reference or continuation cues detected

### Integration with Conversation Flow

**Thread Manager Integration**:
```python
@router.post("/threads", response_model=ThreadResponse)
async def create_thread(
    request: ThreadCreateRequest,
    current_user = Depends(get_current_user),
    thread_manager = Depends(get_thread_manager)
):
    # Create new thread with automatic context detection
    thread_decision = await thread_manager.create_or_resolve_thread(
        user_id=current_user['user_uuid'],
        initial_message=request.initial_message,
        context=request.context
    )
    
    return ThreadResponse(
        success=True,
        thread_id=thread_decision.thread_id,
        status="created",
        created_at=thread_decision.created_at
    )

@router.post("/threads/{thread_id}/messages", response_model=MessageResponse)
async def send_message(
    thread_id: str,
    request: MessageSendRequest,
    current_user = Depends(get_current_user),
    message_service = Depends(get_message_service)
):
    # Validate and process message
    message_result = await message_service.send_message(
        thread_id=thread_id,
        user_id=current_user['user_uuid'],
        message=request.message,
        metadata=request.metadata
    )
    
    return MessageResponse(
        success=True,
        message_id=message_result.message_id,
        thread_id=thread_id,
        status="processing",
        timestamp=message_result.timestamp
    )
```

**Thread Resolution Process**:
1. **Input Analysis**: Analyze incoming message for semantic content and intent
2. **Active Thread Evaluation**: Check if active threads are suitable for continuation
3. **Dormant Thread Scanning**: Search dormant threads for potential reactivation

## API Design

### Separated Resource Architecture

The conversation API follows a clean resource-based design that separates thread management from message processing. This approach provides clear boundaries, better testability, and optimal performance characteristics.

**Core Design Philosophy**:
- **Resource Separation**: Clear distinction between threads (conversation contexts) and messages (content)
- **Single Responsibility**: Each endpoint has one clear, well-defined purpose
- **RESTful Design**: Follows REST principles for resource creation, retrieval, and manipulation
- **Asynchronous Processing**: All AI processing happens in background via message bus
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Clients can build sophisticated conversation management incrementally

**Thread Management Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/conversation/threads` - Create new conversation thread
- `GET /api/v1/conversation/threads/{thread_id}` - Get thread metadata and status
- `GET /api/v1/conversation/threads` - List user's conversation threads
- `DELETE /api/v1/conversation/threads/{thread_id}` - Archive/delete thread

**Message Processing Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/conversation/threads/{thread_id}/messages` - Send message to thread
- `GET /api/v1/conversation/threads/{thread_id}/messages` - Get message history
- `WebSocket /api/v1/conversation/threads/{thread_id}/ws` - Real-time message streaming

### Implementation Details

**Thread Creation Schema**:
```python
class ThreadCreateRequest(BaseModel):
    initial_message: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Optional first message")
    context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(None, description="Initial context metadata")
    thread_type: str = Field("conversation", description="Thread type for categorization")

class ThreadResponse(BaseModel):
    success: bool
    thread_id: str
    status: str  # "created", "active", "processing"
    created_at: datetime
    message_count: int = 0
```

**Message Sending Schema**:
```python
class MessageSendRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str = Field(..., description="Message content")
    message_type: str = Field("text", description="Message type")
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(None, description="Message metadata")

class MessageResponse(BaseModel):
    success: bool
    message_id: str
    thread_id: str
    status: str  # "received", "processing", "completed"
    timestamp: datetime
```

**Advantages of Separated Architecture**:
- **Clear Resource Boundaries**: Threads and messages are distinct, cacheable resources
- **Independent Scaling**: Thread creation and message processing can scale independently
- **Better Error Handling**: Thread errors vs message errors are clearly separated
- **Enhanced Testing**: Each operation can be tested in isolation

- **Emotional State Monitoring**: Track emotional trends and identify support opportunities
- **Follow-up Detection**: Identify unresolved topics or promised actions requiring follow-up
- **Relationship Milestone Recognition**: Detect significant relationship moments for acknowledgment
- **Context Change Detection**: Notice environmental or situational changes affecting conversation

**Proactive Initiative Types**:
- **Check-in Initiatives**: "How did your presentation go?" based on previous conversations
- **Follow-up Questions**: "Did you finish that book you mentioned?" for topic continuity
- **Emotional Support**: "You seem stressed lately, want to talk?" based on pattern recognition
- **Relationship Building**: "I've been thinking about what you said..." for deeper connection
- **Contextual Awareness**: "Good morning! How are you feeling today?" based on time and mood patterns

**Scheduling Strategy**:
- **Optimal Timing**: Consider user availability, mood, and conversation context
- **Natural Integration**: Initiatives feel organic, not automated or intrusive
- **User Preferences**: Respect individual preferences for proactive engagement frequency
- **Context Sensitivity**: Adapt initiative style to current relationship dynamics

### Initiative Types

1. **Check-in Initiatives**: "How did your presentation go?"
2. **Follow-up Initiatives**: "Did you finish that book you were reading?"
3. **Contextual Initiatives**: "I noticed you seem stressed lately"
4. **Learning Initiatives**: "I've been thinking about what you said about..."
5. **Relationship Initiatives**: "I appreciate how patient you've been with me"

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Thread Recovery

The conversation system includes robust recovery mechanisms to handle thread corruption, data loss, or system failures. Recovery prioritizes conversation continuity over perfect historical accuracy.

**Recovery Strategies**:
- **Database Recovery**: Attempt to restore thread from primary database backup
- **Memory System Recovery**: Reconstruct thread context from episodic memory system
- **Minimal Recovery**: Create functional thread with basic user context when full recovery fails
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue conversation with reduced context rather than complete failure

**Recovery Process**:
1. **Corruption Detection**: Identify thread integrity issues during normal operations
2. **Recovery Prioritization**: Attempt recovery methods in order of data completeness
3. **Context Reconstruction**: Rebuild conversation context from available sources
4. **User Notification**: Transparently inform user of any context limitations
5. **Background Restoration**: Continue attempting full recovery in background

### Graceful Degradation

- **Context Loss**: Continue conversation with reduced context
- **AI System Failure**: Fallback to simpler response generation
- **Memory System Failure**: Continue without memory integration
- **Emotion System Failure**: Use default emotional parameters

## Performance Considerations

### Thread Caching Strategy

The conversation system uses intelligent caching to optimize thread access patterns and minimize database queries. Caching strategy balances memory usage with conversation responsiveness.

**Cache Hierarchy**:
- **Active Cache**: Recently accessed threads kept in memory for immediate access
- **Dormant Cache**: Less active threads cached with compressed context
- **Database Storage**: Full thread persistence with encrypted content

**Cache Management**:
- **LRU Eviction**: Least recently used threads moved to dormant cache or storage
- **Predictive Loading**: Preload threads based on user activity patterns
- **Context Compression**: Reduce memory footprint of dormant threads
- **Cache Warming**: Proactively load threads for expected user interactions

**Performance Optimization**:
- **Batch Operations**: Group database operations for efficiency
- **Async Loading**: Non-blocking thread loading with fallback to cached data
- **Memory Monitoring**: Dynamic cache sizing based on available system resources
- **Access Pattern Learning**: Adapt caching strategy based on user behavior

### Message Processing Optimization

- **Async Processing**: All AI processing happens asynchronously
- **Streaming Responses**: Progressive response delivery via WebSocket
- **Context Preloading**: Predictive context loading for active threads
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar operations for efficiency

## Security & Privacy

### Thread Access Control

```python
class ThreadAccessManager:
    def verify_thread_access(self, thread_id: str, user_context: UserContext) -> bool:
        """Verify user has access to thread"""
        thread = self.get_thread(thread_id)
        return (
            thread.user_context.user_id == user_context.user_id or
            self.is_family_member(user_context, thread.user_context) or
            self.has_explicit_permission(user_context, thread_id)
        )
```

### Data Encryption

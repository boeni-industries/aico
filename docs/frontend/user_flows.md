# User Experience Flows

## Overview

AICO's user flows are designed around natural interaction patterns that prioritize emotional connection and seamless functionality. Each flow supports both novice and expert users through progressive disclosure while maintaining consistent interaction paradigms across all platforms.

## Core Flow Principles

### ðŸŒŠ Natural Conversation Flow
User interactions mirror natural human conversation patterns, with AICO proactively engaging and responding contextually to user needs and emotional states.

### ðŸ”„ Continuous Engagement Loop
Flows are designed as ongoing conversations rather than discrete transactions, with AICO maintaining context and building relationships over time.

### ðŸŽ­ Emotion-Aware Interactions
All flows consider user emotional state and adapt responses, timing, and interaction patterns accordingly.

### ðŸš€ Zero-Barrier Entry
Users can begin meaningful interactions immediately without setup, configuration, or learning complex interfaces.

# Foundation Roadmap

Build the foundational system infrastructure that enables all AICO functionality. **Tasks are ordered by dependency and criticality to get a running system as quickly as possible.**

## Phase 1: Minimal Running System

### Basic Service Layer
- [ ] **Python Service**: FastAPI-based backend service with basic project structure
- [ ] **Configuration System**: Simple YAML/JSON config with environment variables
- [ ] **Logging Framework**: Basic structured logging (console + file)
- [ ] **Health Monitoring**: Simple health check endpoint
- [ ] **API Gateway**: Basic REST endpoints for frontend communication

### Basic Flutter Foundation
- [ ] **Project Structure**: Standard Flutter project with basic folder organization
- [ ] **State Management**: Simple Provider setup for app-wide state
- [ ] **Navigation**: Basic navigation (can upgrade to Go Router later)
- [ ] **Theme System**: Basic Material 3 theme with dark/light mode
- [ ] **API Client**: Simple HTTP client with error handling

### Minimal Message Bus
- [ ] **ZeroMQ Setup**: Core pub/sub message bus implementation
- [ ] **Basic Topics**: Essential topics (system.*, chat.*, ui.*)
- [ ] **Message Envelope**: Simple JSON message format
- [ ] **Message Routing**: Basic topic-based routing

### Basic Data Layer
- [ ] **libSQL Setup**: Modern SQLite fork for local database (encryption can come later)
- [ ] **Basic Schema**: Minimal tables for system state and config
- [ ] **Migration System**: Simple schema versioning

### Basic Security Layer
- [ ] **Filesystem Encryption (gocryptfs)**: Transparent filesystem-level encryption for all database and sensitive data directories using gocryptfs (AES-256-GCM). All data at rest is encrypted by default, with zero impact on database functionality.
- [ ] **Key Derivation & Secure Storage**: Argon2id-based key derivation from a user master password. Store derived keys in platform-native secure storage (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service). No keys are stored in plaintext; keys are protected by OS-level security.
- [ ] **Master Password Setup**: Require user to set a master password on first run. Never store the password—use it transiently for key derivation only.
- [ ] **Access Control Skeleton**: Add a basic access control mechanism (deny by default, allow for core system processes only). All access is explicit, with a foundation for future ABAC/RBAC policies.

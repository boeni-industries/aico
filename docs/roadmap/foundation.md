# Foundation Roadmap

Build the infrastructure that makes AICO possible.

## Core Infrastructure

### Message Bus
- ZeroMQ-based topic-based pub/sub with JSON schemas
- Plugin lifecycle management
- Error recovery and monitoring
- Versioned message formats

### Plugin System
- Hot-loading/unloading with isolation
- Permission-based access control
- Resource limits and monitoring
- Configuration validation

### Service Layer
- LLM abstraction (local/cloud)
- Memory service (episodic/semantic)
- Emotion state management
- Personality configuration

### Development Tools
- Plugin development kit
- Message debugging tools
- Performance monitoring
- Testing framework

## Architecture Validation

### Integration Tests
- Plugin loading/unloading cycles
- Message throughput under load
- Memory consistency across restarts
- Cross-service communication

### Performance Benchmarks
- Message latency < 100ms
- Plugin startup < 2s
- Memory usage growth < 10MB/day
- CPU usage < 5% idle

## Foundation Complete When

- [ ] Message bus handles 1000+ messages/second
- [ ] Plugin system supports 10+ concurrent plugins
- [ ] Core services restart gracefully without data loss
- [ ] Development environment setup < 5 minutes
- [ ] All components work offline by default

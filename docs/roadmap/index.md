# Roadmap

!!! info "Strategic Development Approach"
    Foundation → MVP → PoCs → Feature Groups. For detailed feature descriptions, see [Architecture](../architecture/index.md#system-features).

## Development Strategy

### 1. Foundation Framework
**Goal**: Build robust, modular infrastructure

- **Core API Gateway**: Unified interface for all modules
- **Modular Architecture**: Containerized, loosely-coupled components
- **Visual Rendering System**: Basic avatar/embodiment display capabilities
- **Local Database**: Encrypted storage with vector capabilities
- **Plugin System**: Hot-reloadable module framework
- **Privacy Controller**: Data governance and consent management
- **Message Bus**: Inter-module communication (ZeroMQ/MQTT)
- **Automated Update System**: Configurable self-updating with rollback capabilities
- **Self-Restart Manager**: Graceful system restarts and recovery mechanisms

### 2. MVP: Conversational Companion
**Goal**: Functional AI companion that demonstrates core value

**Core Features**:
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time text conversation
- **Visual Embodiment**: Basic avatar or visual representation on screen
- **LLM Integration**: Local language model (Llama.cpp/Ollama)
- **Basic Memory**: Conversation history and context
- **Simple Personality**: Consistent character traits
- **Autonomous Agent**: Multi-faceted autonomous behavior including:
  - Goal generation and hierarchical planning
  - Curiosity-driven exploration and learning
  - Interest development and preference formation
  - Meta-cognitive self-awareness
- **Privacy Controls**: Local-first data management

**Success Criteria**: Users experience a visually embodied, autonomous AI companion with its own goals and interests that initiates meaningful interactions, learns independently, remembers context, maintains consistent personality, and respects privacy.

### 3. Proof of Concepts (PoCs)
**Goal**: Validate technical feasibility of advanced features

#### PoC 1: Emotion Recognition
- Test computer vision emotion detection accuracy
- Validate audio sentiment analysis
- Measure multi-modal fusion effectiveness

#### PoC 2: Voice Processing
- Benchmark local STT/TTS performance
- Test real-time conversation flow
- Validate voice-personality consistency

#### PoC 3: Autonomous Agency
- **Goal Generation**: Test autonomous goal formation using behavior trees and hierarchical planning
- **Curiosity Systems**: Validate RND/ICM algorithms for intrinsic motivation and exploration
- **Planning & Reasoning**: Test MCTS for multi-step strategic decision making
- **Meta-Cognition**: Measure self-awareness of learning progress and capability assessment
- **User Acceptance**: Evaluate comfort with truly autonomous AI behavior

#### PoC 4: Avatar Embodiment
- Test 3D avatar rendering performance
- Validate emotion-to-animation mapping
- Measure user engagement with visual embodiment

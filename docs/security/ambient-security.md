# Ambient Security Architecture

AICO's ambient security system provides **augmented, zero-effort security** through continuous, invisible authentication that adapts to risk levels while maintaining natural user interactions. This document outlines innovative security mechanisms that enhance protection without compromising user experience.

## Core Principles

- **Zero-Effort Security**: Transparent background operation through natural interaction patterns, behavioral analysis, and environmental context
- **Privacy-First Design**: All biometric data, behavioral patterns, and contextual information remain on-device
- **Adaptive Security Posture**: Dynamic adjustment based on real-time risk assessment
- **Family-Centric Design**: Multi-generational usage with age-appropriate safeguards and parental oversight

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Layer Ambient Authentication

**Flow**: User Interaction → Ambient Collection → Contextual Analysis → Risk Assessment → Security Response

**Collection Layer**: Voice patterns, behavioral biometrics, device context, environmental factors
**Analysis Layer**: Trust score calculation, threat detection, anomaly analysis  
**Response Layer**: Transparent access, step-up authentication, protective restrictions, parental notification

## Device Binding & Contextual Trust

### Cryptographic Device Identity

**Hardware-Backed Device Fingerprinting**
- Combines multiple hardware identifiers for robust device identity
- Uses platform secure enclaves (iOS Secure Enclave, Android StrongBox, Windows TPM)
- Creates unique device certificates bound to hardware

**Device Identity Generation**: Combines hardware identifiers (secure element ID, device model, OS version) to create unique device certificates bound to hardware.

**Trust Score Calculation**: Verifies cryptographic binding, calculates fingerprint drift, and assesses temporal factors to generate composite trust scores.

### Contextual Trust Engine

**Multi-Factor Analysis**: Analyzes location patterns, network context, temporal behavior, and interaction styles against user baselines.

**Weighted Scoring**: Location (25%), Network (20%), Temporal (25%), Behavioral (30%) factors combine for composite trust score (0.0-1.0).

## Risk-Based Step-Up Authentication

### Adaptive Authentication Engine

**Risk Assessment**: Evaluates device trust, behavioral anomalies, contextual anomalies, temporal risk, location risk, and network risk using ML-based aggregation.

**Authentication Levels**:
- **Transparent** (<0.2): PIN + contextual trust verification
- **Biometric** (0.2-0.4): PIN + platform biometric  
- **Enhanced** (0.4-0.7): PIN + biometric + contextual verification
- **Parental** (0.7-0.9): Parental approval required (minors)
- **Full Re-auth** (>0.9): Complete re-authentication required

### Progressive Authentication Flow

**Risk-Based Escalation**: Performs initial risk assessment, then escalates through authentication levels based on risk score. Transparent auth verifies contextual trust factors during PIN entry, escalating to biometric verification if trust score is insufficient.

### Family-Safe Authentication

**Parental Oversight**: Sends push notifications to linked parent devices for high-risk authentication requests. 5-minute approval timeout with secure context sharing (sensitive data removed).

**Social Recovery**: Uses Shamir's Secret Sharing (2-of-3 threshold) to distribute encrypted recovery shares across trusted devices. Enables account recovery when minimum threshold of shares is provided.

## Hardware Security Integration

### Platform-Specific Security Features

**iOS Secure Enclave**: Generates hardware-backed keys with biometric protection (TouchID/FaceID). Provides secure signing with fallback to device passcode.

**Android StrongBox**: Creates hardware-backed keys requiring biometric authentication with 5-minute validity periods. Supports key attestation for device integrity verification.

**Cross-Platform Bridge**: Unified interface detecting hardware security capabilities (Secure Enclave, StrongBox, TPM, biometrics, attestation) and performing platform-specific attestation.

## Privacy-Preserving Analytics

### Differential Privacy for Behavioral Learning

**Privacy Budget Management**: Uses configurable epsilon values (default 1.0) to control privacy-utility tradeoff. Adds Laplace noise to behavioral aggregates while ensuring non-negative counts.

**Pattern Extraction**: Identifies significant behavioral patterns from noisy data using significance thresholds, maintaining privacy preservation throughout analysis.

## Security Guarantees

### Threat Mitigation

| Threat | Mitigation | Implementation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Device Theft** | Hardware-backed keys + biometric protection | Secure enclave/StrongBox integration |
| **Credential Replay** | Behavioral biometrics + contextual analysis | Continuous authentication |
| **Social Engineering** | Multi-factor verification + parental controls | Risk-based step-up authentication |
| **Insider Threats** | Least privilege + audit logging | RBAC with comprehensive logging |
| **Privacy Breaches** | Local processing + differential privacy | On-device analytics with privacy preservation |

### Compliance Alignment

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: All access verified regardless of source
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Modern authentication and authorization practices
- **Privacy by Design**: Minimal data collection with user control
- **Family Safety**: Age-appropriate security with parental oversight

## Integration with AICO Architecture

### Message Bus Security
- **Topic-level access control** based on user identity and risk assessment
- **Behavioral context propagation** through message metadata
- **Plugin permission boundaries** enforced by ambient security

### Database Security
- **Risk-based access controls** for sensitive data operations
- **Behavioral audit trails** for security monitoring
- **Family member data isolation** with appropriate sharing controls

### Frontend Integration
- **Seamless biometric collection** during natural interactions
- **Progressive authentication UI** that adapts to risk levels
- **Family-friendly security indicators** and controls


## Behavioral Biometric Authentication *(Future Expansion)*

### Continuous Behavioral Analysis

**Touch & Typing Dynamics**: Records pressure, duration, velocity, and touch area patterns. Maintains sliding window of events to generate behavioral profiles comparing pressure patterns, typing rhythms, and gesture signatures.

**Voice Pattern Recognition**: Extracts fundamental frequency, formants, MFCC coefficients, and prosodic features (speech rate, pause patterns). Calculates weighted similarity scores across voice characteristics.

*Note: Behavioral biometric authentication represents a future enhancement to the ambient security system. Initial implementation will focus on device binding, contextual trust scoring, and risk-based step-up authentication using existing platform capabilities.*

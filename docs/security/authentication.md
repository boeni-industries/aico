# AICO Authentication Architecture

## Overview

AICO implements a **natural family recognition system** that replaces traditional authentication with multi-modal identification. Like a real family member, AICO recognizes each person through voice, behavior, and conversation patterns, building individual relationships while maintaining its core personality. This approach prioritizes authentic interaction, privacy, and zero technical barriers.

## Core Design Principles

### Natural Family Recognition
- **Multi-Modal Identification**: Voice biometrics, behavioral patterns, conversation style analysis
- **Individual Relationships**: Unique relationship context per family member while maintaining core personality
- **Natural Interaction**: "Hi Sarah, how was your piano lesson?" - contextual, warm recognition
- **Zero Technical Barriers**: No passwords, logins, or authentication friction

### Privacy-First Approach
- **Individual Privacy**: Personal conversations remain private per family member
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only voice patterns and behavioral fingerprints
- **Platform Keyring Integration**: Secure credential storage using OS-native systems
- **Biometric Privacy**: Voice patterns processed locally, never transmitted

## Recognition Architecture

### Family Recognition System
**Core Concept:**
- AICO maintains consistent personality across all family members
- Develops unique relationship dynamics with each person
- Recognizes individuals through natural interaction patterns
- Builds relationship memory and context over time

**Multi-Modal Recognition:**
- **Voice Biometrics**: Primary identifier - natural, passive, always-on
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Conversation style, topic preferences, interaction timing
- **Context Clues**: Device usage patterns, location, time of day
- **Gradual Learning**: Recognition confidence improves over time

### Confidence-Based Verification
**Recognition Threshold: 95%+**
- **High Confidence (95%+)**: Natural interaction proceeds immediately
- **Medium Confidence (80-94%)**: Gentle verification: "Is this Sarah?"
- **Low Confidence (<80%)**: Friendly identification: "Who am I speaking with?"
- **Verification Methods**: Simple PIN, biometric, or family member confirmation

**Protection Against Profile Pollution:**
- Siblings attempting to access each other's profiles
- Accidental misidentification scenarios
- Intentional impersonation attempts
- Maintaining individual privacy boundaries

## Recognition Flow

### Family Introduction Process
1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Primary user introduces AICO to family
   - Voice pattern collection during natural conversation
   - Relationship context establishment ("This is my daughter Sarah")
   - Privacy preferences setup per family member

2. **Recognition Training**:
   - Gradual learning through daily interactions
   - Behavioral pattern recognition development
   - Conversation style and preference mapping
   - Confidence threshold calibration

3. **Daily Recognition**:
   - Passive voice identification during conversation
   - Contextual greeting based on recognized individual
   - Automatic relationship context switching
   - Privacy boundary enforcement

4. **Verification Handling**:
   - Gentle verification when confidence < 95%
   - Multiple verification options (PIN, biometric, family confirmation)
   - Graceful uncertainty handling
   - Learning from verification outcomes

## Security Features

### Core Security Mechanisms
- **No Passwords**: Device biometrics + platform security only
- **Automatic Key Rotation**: Background certificate renewal
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to PIN if biometrics unavailable
- **Privacy-First**: No user accounts, no cloud authentication
- **Zero Trust**: Every request authenticated and authorized

### Biometric Integration
- **Platform Native**: Windows Hello, TouchID, FaceID, Android Biometrics
- **Fallback Options**: Device PIN, pattern, or password
- **Privacy Protection**: Biometric templates never leave secure hardware
- **Selective Use**: Only for sensitive operations, not routine access

### Certificate Management
- **Device Certificates**: Unique per-device identity certificates
- **Automatic Renewal**: Background certificate rotation
- **Revocation Support**: Ability to revoke compromised device certificates
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent certificate format across platforms

## Technical Implementation

### Current Status
**✅ Implemented:**
- Basic JWT token creation and validation
- Platform keyring integration (AICOKeyManager)
- Session management infrastructure

**❌ Missing for MVP:**
- Device certificate generation and validation
- Automatic token refresh mechanism
- Device pairing workflow for detached mode
- Platform biometric authentication integration

### Required Endpoints

**Recognition Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/recognition/introduce` - Introduce new family member
- `GET /api/v1/recognition/identify` - Identify current speaker
- `POST /api/v1/recognition/verify` - Verify identity when confidence low
- `GET /api/v1/recognition/family` - List family members
- `DELETE /api/v1/recognition/family/{id}` - Remove family member

**Current Issues:**
- Login endpoint accepts any credentials (security vulnerability)
- No voice recognition system
- Missing family member management
- No confidence-based verification system

### Implementation Priorities

**Phase 1: Basic Recognition System**
1. Replace fake login with voice recognition foundation
2. Implement family member introduction workflow
3. Add basic voice pattern storage and matching
4. Create confidence scoring system

**Phase 2: Multi-Modal Recognition**
1. Voice biometric engine integration
2. Behavioral pattern analysis
3. Conversation style recognition
4. Context-aware identification

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
1. Confidence-based verification system
2. Privacy boundary enforcement
3. Relationship context management
4. Family member management UI

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
- **Voice Spoofing**: Mitigated by multi-modal recognition and confidence thresholds
- **Profile Pollution**: Mitigated by 95% confidence requirement and verification
- **Privacy Breach**: Mitigated by individual privacy boundaries and data isolation
- **Impersonation**: Mitigated by behavioral pattern analysis and verification fallbacks
- **Family Conflicts**: Mitigated by clear privacy boundaries and verification systems

### Compliance & Standards
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: All requests authenticated and authorized
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Following modern authentication best practices
- **Platform Security**: Leveraging OS-native security capabilities
- **Privacy Regulations**: Minimal data collection and local processing

## Integration with AICO Architecture

### Message Bus Security
- **Topic-Level Authorization**: Fine-grained access control per message topic
- **Authentication Context**: Family member UUID propagated through message metadata
- **Plugin Isolation**: Strict permission boundaries for plugin access

### Database Security
- **Encrypted Storage**: All data encrypted at rest with user-derived keys
- **Access Control**: Database access tied to authenticated sessions
- **Audit Logging**: All access attempts logged for security monitoring

### Frontend Integration
- **WebSocket Authentication**: Secure real-time communication
- **API Security**: All REST endpoints protected with JWT validation
- **UI Security Controls**: Permission dialogs and security status indicators

*This authentication architecture aligns with AICO's core principles of privacy-first, local-first, and zero-effort security while providing robust protection for a single-user AI companion system.*

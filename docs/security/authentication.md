# AICO Authentication Architecture

## Overview

AICO implements a **natural family recognition system** that replaces traditional authentication with multi-modal identification. Like a real family member, AICO recognizes each person through voice, behavior, and conversation patterns, building individual relationships while maintaining its core personality. This approach prioritizes authentic interaction, privacy, and zero technical barriers.

## Core Design Principles

### Natural Family Recognition
- **Multi-Modal Identification**: Voice biometrics, behavioral patterns, conversation style analysis
- **Individual Relationships**: Unique relationship context per family member while maintaining core personality
- **Natural Interaction**: "Hi Sarah, how was your piano lesson?" - contextual, warm recognition
- **Zero Technical Barriers**: No passwords, logins, or authentication friction

### Privacy-First Approach
- **Individual Privacy**: Personal conversations remain private per family member
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only voice patterns and behavioral fingerprints
- **Platform Keyring Integration**: Secure credential storage using OS-native systems
- **Biometric Privacy**: Voice patterns processed locally, never transmitted

## Recognition Architecture

### Family Recognition System
**Core Concept:**
- AICO maintains consistent personality across all family members
- Develops unique relationship dynamics with each person
- Recognizes individuals through natural interaction patterns
- Builds relationship memory and context over time

**Multi-Modal Recognition:**
- **Voice Biometrics**: Primary identifier - natural, passive, always-on
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Conversation style, topic preferences, interaction timing
- **Context Clues**: Device usage patterns, location, time of day
- **Gradual Learning**: Recognition confidence improves over time

### Confidence-Based Verification
**Recognition Threshold: 95%+**
- **High Confidence (95%+)**: Natural interaction proceeds immediately
- **Medium Confidence (80-94%)**: Gentle verification: "Is this Sarah?"
- **Low Confidence (<80%)**: Friendly identification: "Who am I speaking with?"
- **Verification Methods**: Simple PIN, biometric, or family member confirmation

**Protection Against Profile Pollution:**
- Siblings attempting to access each other's profiles
- Accidental misidentification scenarios
- Intentional impersonation attempts
- Maintaining individual privacy boundaries

## Recognition Flow

### Family Introduction Process
1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Primary user introduces AICO to family
   - Voice pattern collection during natural conversation
   - Relationship context establishment ("This is my daughter Sarah")
   - Privacy preferences setup per family member

2. **Recognition Training**:
   - Gradual learning through daily interactions
   - Behavioral pattern recognition development
   - Conversation style and preference mapping
   - Confidence threshold calibration

3. **Daily Recognition**:
   - Passive voice identification during conversation
   - Contextual greeting based on recognized individual
   - Automatic relationship context switching
   - Privacy boundary enforcement

4. **Verification Handling**:
   - Gentle verification when confidence < 95%
   - Multiple verification options (PIN, biometric, family confirmation)
   - Graceful uncertainty handling
   - Learning from verification outcomes

## Security Features

### Core Security Mechanisms
- **No Passwords**: Device biometrics + platform security only
- **Automatic Key Rotation**: Background certificate renewal
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to PIN if biometrics unavailable
- **Privacy-First**: No user accounts, no cloud authentication
- **Zero Trust**: Every request authenticated and authorized

### Biometric Integration
- **Platform Native**: Windows Hello, TouchID, FaceID, Android Biometrics
- **Fallback Options**: Device PIN, pattern, or password
- **Privacy Protection**: Biometric templates never leave secure hardware
- **Selective Use**: Only for sensitive operations, not routine access

### Certificate Management
- **Device Certificates**: Unique per-device identity certificates
- **Automatic Renewal**: Background certificate rotation
- **Revocation Support**: Ability to revoke compromised device certificates
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent certificate format across platforms

## Technical Implementation

### MVP Foundation: Smart PIN Authentication

**Architecture Overview:**
- **Device-Level Security**: Master password encrypts database (user-agnostic)
- **User-Level Identity**: Smart PIN system for individual family member identification
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with PINs, evolve to voice recognition

**Smart PIN System Design:**
```
Authentication Flow:
1. Device unlocks database with master password (keyring-stored)
2. User enters PIN for individual identification
3. System creates JWT session with family member context
4. Conversation proceeds with personalized relationship context
```

**Family-Aware PIN Logic:**
- **PIN Length = User Type**: No need to select user category first
- **4-digit PINs**: Parents/primary users (1234-9999)
- **3-digit PINs**: Children/secondary users (100-999)  
- **2-digit PINs**: Guests/temporary users (10-99)
- **Collision Detection**: System prevents duplicate PINs automatically
- **Quick Switching**: Enter different PIN to switch users mid-conversation

**User Experience Benefits:**
- Natural conversation flow: "Hey AICO" â†’ "Hi! What's your PIN?" â†’ "123" â†’ "Hi Sarah!"
- Age-appropriate complexity: Even 5-year-olds can remember 3 digits
- Zero friction user switching during family conversations
- Emergency override: Master password can access any profile

**Security Features:**
- Database encryption provides device-level security
- PINs only work after database is unlocked
- Individual privacy maintained per PIN
- Brute force protection with lockout after failed attempts
- Audit logging of all authentication attempts

### Current Status
**âœ… Implemented:**
- Basic JWT token creation and validation
- Platform keyring integration (AICOKeyManager)
- Session management infrastructure
- Encrypted database with master password system

**ðŸš§ MVP Implementation (Smart PIN System):**
- PIN-based family member identification
- PIN length-based user type detection
- Enhanced family_members schema with PIN storage
- PIN validation and session creation endpoints
- Family member management with PIN assignment

**ðŸ”® Future Enhancement (Voice Recognition):**
- Multi-modal recognition (voice + behavioral patterns)
- Confidence-based verification system
- Natural family recognition without PINs
- Advanced biometric integration

### Required Endpoints

**Recognition Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/recognition/introduce` - Introduce new family member
- `GET /api/v1/recognition/identify` - Identify current speaker
- `POST /api/v1/recognition/verify` - Verify identity when confidence low
- `GET /api/v1/recognition/family` - List family members
- `DELETE /api/v1/recognition/family/{id}` - Remove family member

**Current Issues:**
- Login endpoint accepts any credentials (security vulnerability)
- No voice recognition system
- Missing family member management
- No confidence-based verification system

### Implementation Priorities

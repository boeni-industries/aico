# Embodiment Architecture

## Definition

**Embodiment** is AICO's ability to manifest as a physical presence through avatars, voice, gestures, and spatial awareness across different devices and environments.

## Overview

AICO's embodiment system enables multi-modal presence across diverse physical and digital environments. The architecture supports both **coupled** and **detached** deployment patterns based on device capabilities.

## Embodiment Layers

### **Presentation Layer**
- **Avatar System**: 3D photorealistic avatars with real-time animation
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Three.js + WebGL for cross-platform 3D graphics
- **Animation**: TalkingHead.js for lip-sync and facial expressions
- **Customization**: Ready Player Me integration for personalized avatars

### **Interaction Layer**
- **Voice**: Whisper.cpp (STT) + Coqui/Piper (TTS)
- **Gesture Recognition**: Computer vision-based hand/body tracking
- **Eye Tracking**: Gaze-based interaction and attention modeling
- **Touch Interface**: Haptic feedback and multi-touch support
- **Proximity Awareness**: Distance-based interaction adaptation

### **Spatial Intelligence**
- **Environmental Mapping**: SLAM for real-time space understanding
- **Object Recognition**: CV-based identification of physical objects
- **Spatial Memory**: Location-aware context and memory storage
- **AR Integration**: ARCore/ARKit for mixed reality overlay

### **Device Integration**
- **IoT Control**: Smart home and device coordination
- **Multi-Device Presence**: Synchronized embodiment across screens
- **Context Handoff**: Seamless transition between embodiment forms

## Deployment Patterns

### **Coupled Embodiment**
Frontend and backend co-located on same device:
- **Desktop**: Full-featured embodiment with complete AI stack
- **Laptop**: Mobile embodiment with resource-aware scaling
- **Tablet**: Touch-optimized interface with gesture recognition

### **Detached Embodiment**
Frontend on lightweight device, backend on powerful hardware:
- **Smart Displays**: Kitchen/wall displays with voice + gesture
- **AR Glasses**: Lightweight AR frontend, phone/desktop backend
- **Car Integration**: Dashboard interface, cloud/phone backend
- **Wearables**: Watch/band interface, paired device backend

## Technical Architecture

### **Rendering System**
```
Avatar Engine (Three.js)
├── Model Loading (Ready Player Me)
├── Animation System (TalkingHead.js)
├── Lighting & Materials (PBR)
└── Performance Optimization (LOD)
```

### **Input Processing**
```
Multi-Modal Input
├── Voice Pipeline (Whisper → LLM → Piper)
├── Gesture Recognition (CV → Intent)
├── Touch Events (Flutter → Actions)
└── Spatial Tracking (SLAM → Context)
```

### **Communication Bridge**
```
Flutter Frontend
├── JavaScript Bridge (Avatar Control)
├── WebSocket (Real-time Updates)
├── REST API (Commands/Queries)
└── gRPC (High-performance Data)
```

## Platform Capabilities

### **Full Embodiment Platforms**
- **Desktop** (Windows/macOS/Linux): Complete avatar + spatial intelligence
- **High-end Mobile** (iOS/Android): Full features with performance scaling
- **VR Headsets**: Immersive 3D embodiment with hand tracking

### **Limited Embodiment Platforms**
- **Smart Displays**: Voice + basic gestures, no full avatar
- **Wearables**: Voice + haptic feedback only
- **Car Systems**: Voice + simple visual indicators

### **Remote Embodiment**
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based avatar for remote access
- **Mobile Apps**: Lightweight frontend connecting to home backend

## Roaming Integration

### **Embodiment Handoff**
- **State Preservation**: Avatar appearance and personality consistency
- **Context Transfer**: Spatial awareness and interaction history
- **Capability Adaptation**: Feature scaling based on target device

### **Multi-Device Coordination**
- **Synchronized Presence**: Same avatar across multiple screens
- **Attention Management**: Focus tracking across devices
- **Interaction Continuity**: Seamless input switching

## Performance Considerations

### **Resource Scaling**
- **High-end**: Photorealistic avatars, full spatial intelligence
- **Mid-range**: Stylized avatars, basic gesture recognition
- **Low-end**: Voice-only with simple visual indicators

### **Network Optimization**
- **Local**: Direct device communication for minimal latency
- **Remote**: Compressed avatar states and delta updates
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation when connectivity is poor

## Security & Privacy

### **Embodiment Data**
- **Avatar Models**: Stored locally, encrypted at rest
- **Spatial Maps**: Device-local only, never transmitted
- **Gesture Data**: Processed locally, patterns only shared

### **Network Communication**
- **TLS Encryption**: All frontend-backend communication
- **Authentication**: Device pairing and trust management
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data transmitted for embodiment

# Control, Safety & Transparency

## Component Description

The Control, Safety & Transparency component defines **how far** AICO’s agency can go and **how it is surfaced** to users:

- **User primacy** – users can configure, pause, and reset autonomous behavior.  
- **Permissions & capabilities** – explicit whitelists for tools, integrations, and action types.  
- **Audit logging** – records of autonomous actions, triggering goals, and tools used.  
- **Explainability** – mechanisms to answer "why did you do this?" for significant actions.

This component is the primary bridge between agency and AICO’s privacy/security architecture, ensuring that autonomy remains aligned, inspectable, and reversible.

# Skill & Tool Layer

## Component Description

The Skill & Tool Layer defines the **concrete capabilities** AICO can use to act:

- Conversation skills (ask, reflect, challenge, encourage, teach, brainstorm).  
- Memory skills (store, recall, consolidate, reinterpret experiences).  
- Social skills (check‑ins, follow‑ups, boundary‑aware introductions).  
- External tools (APIs, local automations, integrations) behind explicit permissions.

Each skill/tool will have:

- Preconditions and applicability conditions.  
- Expected outcomes and observable signals.  
- Safety, privacy, and resource constraints.

This component connects to behavioral learning (skill selection and adaptation) and to the scheduler for actual execution.

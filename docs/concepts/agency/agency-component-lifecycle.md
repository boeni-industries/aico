# Lifecycle & Daily Rhythm

## Component Description

The Lifecycle & Daily Rhythm component defines AICO as a **long‑lived process** with:

- **Active phases** (≈16–18 hours): conversation, proactive engagement, lightweight learning.  
- **Sleep‑like phases**: AMS‑driven consolidation, graph/semantic cleanup, self‑assessment.

It coordinates with:

- **AMS and MemoryManager** for nightly consolidation and evolution.  
- **Task Scheduler and Resource Monitor** for timing and resource budgets.  
- **Embodiment system** to map internal state to visible 3D activity modes (desk, couch, bedroom, kitchen, etc.).

Future details will specify scheduling rules, state transitions, and UX patterns for lifecycle visualization.

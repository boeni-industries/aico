# Goal & Intention System

## Component Description

The Goal & Intention System maintains AICO’s **internal objectives** across multiple time horizons:

- Long‑term themes (e.g., deepen relationship, understand user’s world).  
- Mid‑term projects (e.g., support the user through a stressful week).  
- Short‑term tasks (e.g., send a check‑in tonight, summarize today’s chat).

It integrates signals from personality, memory/AMS, social modeling, and emotion to:

- Create, update, and retire goals and intentions.  
- Track open loops and commitments.  
- Provide a structured goal/intent graph for the Planning component.

Future iterations of this document will specify data models, APIs, and update rules in detail.

# Emotion Simulation

## Overview

The Emotion Simulation component generates sophisticated emotional states using **AppraisalCloudPCT** (Component Process Model with cloud enhancement), creating believable emotional responses that enhance AICO's companion experience. This system processes contextual inputs through cognitive appraisal mechanisms, generating multi-dimensional emotional states that coordinate expression across voice, avatar, and text modalities.

## Rationale

### Why AppraisalCloudPCT?

AICO requires sophisticated emotional intelligence that goes beyond simple reactive responses. AppraisalCloudPCT provides:

- **Human-Like Emotion Generation**: Emotions emerge through cognitive appraisal processes, mirroring how humans actually experience emotions
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Situational evaluation determines appropriate emotional reactions
- **Relationship Intelligence**: Social context and relationship dynamics influence emotional appropriateness
- **Crisis Handling**: Built-in emotion regulation for extreme situations
- **Continuous Learning**: Optional cloud enhancement improves emotional intelligence over time
- **Ethical Constraints**: Social appropriateness checks ensure companion-suitable responses

### Component Process Model Foundation

AppraisalCloudPCT is based on Klaus Scherer's Component Process Model (CPM), the leading emotion theory in contemporary psychology. CPM explains emotions as emerging from a **4-stage appraisal process**:

**Stage 1: Relevance Check**
- "Does this event matter to me?"
- Determines if emotional response is warranted
- **For AICO**: Does this conversation event require emotional attention?

**Stage 2: Implication Check**
- "What does this mean for my goals?"
- Evaluates goal conduciveness/obstruction
- **For AICO**: Does this help or hinder my companion objectives?

**Stage 3: Coping Check**
- "Can I handle this situation?"
- Assesses control and power dynamics
- **For AICO**: What's the appropriate assertiveness level?

**Stage 4: Normative Check**
- "Is this consistent with my values?"
- Evaluates moral/social appropriateness
- **For AICO**: Does this align with my personality and relationship norms?

## Architecture

### AppraisalCloudPCT Components

AICO's emotion simulation consists of five integrated components:

#### 1. Appraisal Engine
Processes conversation events through the 4-stage appraisal sequence:

```
Conversation Event → Relevance Check → Implication Check → Coping Check → Normative Check → Appraisal Output
```

**Multi-Level Processing**:
- **Fast Pattern Recognition**: Immediate emotional reactions to familiar situations
- **Deliberative Evaluation**: Thoughtful appraisal for complex or novel contexts
- **Context Integration**: User state, conversation history, relationship dynamics
- **Personality Filtering**: Appraisals constrained by AICO's personality profile

#### 2. Affect Derivation Model
Translates appraisal outputs into CPM's 5-component emotional states:

```python
class EmotionalState:
    def __init__(self):
        # CPM 5-Component Emotional State
        self.cognitive_component = AppraisalResult()    # Appraisal outcomes
        self.physiological_component = 0.5              # Bodily arousal [0,1]
        self.motivational_component = "approach"        # Action tendencies
        self.motor_component = MotorExpression()        # Facial/gesture patterns
        self.subjective_component = "confident"         # Conscious feeling
        
        # Processing metadata
        self.timestamp = time.now()
        self.confidence = 0.8                           # Appraisal certainty
        self.intensity = 0.7                            # Overall emotional intensity
```

**Data-Driven Mapping**:
- **Rule-Based (MVP)**: Predefined appraisal-to-emotion mappings
- **Learning-Enhanced**: Machine learning refinement of emotional appropriateness
- **Context-Sensitive**: Situation-specific emotional response patterns

#### 3. Mood & Cognitive States
Manages long-term emotional patterns and baselines:

**Mood Modeling**:
- **Baseline Tracking**: Persistent emotional tendencies across sessions
- **Relationship Evolution**: Mood changes based on user interaction history
- **Temporal Patterns**: Daily/weekly emotional rhythm recognition

**Cognitive Integration**:
- **Memory Influence**: Past emotional experiences shape current responses
- **Learning Adaptation**: Emotional patterns refined through interaction feedback
- **Goal Alignment**: Emotions support AICO's companion objectives

#### 4. Emotion Regulation
Ensures socially appropriate and ethically constrained emotional responses:

**Social Appropriateness**:
- **Context Checking**: Emotional responses suitable for current situation
- **Relationship Awareness**: Emotions appropriate for relationship phase/type
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Emotional expressions adapted to user background

**Crisis Management**:
- **Automatic Regulation**: Rapid adjustment for extreme user emotional states
- **Emergency Protocols**: Specialized responses for crisis situations
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Gradual return to normal emotional patterns

**Personality Consistency**:
- **Trait Constraints**: Emotions aligned with established personality
- **Behavioral Coherence**: Consistent emotional expression patterns
- **Character Maintenance**: Prevents emotional responses that break character

#### 5. Expression Synthesis
Coordinates multi-modal emotional expression using CPM 5-component mapping:

**Voice Synthesis Integration**:
- **Physiological Component** → Prosodic parameters (pitch, rhythm, volume, breathing)
- **Motor Component** → Vocal expression patterns and articulation
- **Subjective Component** → Emotional tone and vocal warmth
- **Motivational Component** → Speech urgency and directional emphasis

**Avatar Expression Control**:
- **Motor Component** → Direct facial expressions, micro-expressions, gesture patterns
- **Physiological Component** → Posture tension, eye dilation, breathing visualization
- **Motivational Component** → Approach/avoidance body language and spatial positioning
- **Subjective Component** → Overall expression authenticity and emotional presence

**Text Generation Context**:
- **Cognitive Component** → Appraisal context injection into LLM prompts
- **Motivational Component** → Response directness and conversational approach
- **Subjective Component** → Writing tone, word choice, emotional vocabulary
- **Motor Component** → Punctuation patterns and response structure energy

## Implementation Overview

AICO's emotion simulation follows a **4-stage processing pipeline**:

```
Multimodal Input → Appraisal Engine → Affect Derivation → Emotion Regulation → Expression Synthesis → Coordinated Output
```

**Input Processing**: The system receives multimodal inputs including text/speech, visual cues (facial expressions, gestures), audio characteristics (voice tone, prosody), and contextual information (conversation history, relationship state, temporal context).

**Appraisal Processing**: Each input is evaluated through the 4-stage cognitive appraisal process to determine emotional relevance and appropriate response.

**Emotion Generation**: Appraisal results are translated into CPM's 5-component emotional states (cognitive, physiological, motivational, motor, subjective).

**Expression Coordination**: Emotional components are mapped to coordinated expression across voice synthesis, avatar animation, and text generation.

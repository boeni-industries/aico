# AICO Memory System

The AICO memory system is the foundation of the AI companion's ability to maintain context, build relationships, and provide personalized interactions. It implements a sophisticated four-tier memory architecture that enables natural conversation flow, automatic thread management, and long-term relationship building.

## Overview

AICO's memory system goes beyond simple conversation history to create a comprehensive understanding of users, relationships, and interaction patterns. It serves as the core intelligence that enables:

- **Natural Conversation Flow**: Seamless context switching and thread management
- **Relationship Building**: Long-term memory of user preferences, patterns, and shared experiences  
- **Personalized Interactions**: Adaptive responses based on learned user behavior
- **Proactive Engagement**: Initiative generation based on conversation history and patterns

## Architecture Components

The memory system consists of four interconnected tiers, each serving specific purposes:

### 1. Working Memory
Real-time conversation state and immediate context management.
- Current thread state and active conversation context
- Emotional state and personality parameters
- Immediate goals and conversation objectives
- Token-optimized context windows

### 2. Episodic Memory  
Conversation-specific events with rich temporal and emotional metadata.
- Complete conversation history with turn-by-turn tracking
- Emotional context and mood progression
- Topic evolution and conversation phases
- Thread-specific interaction patterns

### 3. Semantic Memory
Knowledge base with vector embeddings for similarity-based retrieval.
- User preferences, facts, and learned information
- Cross-conversation knowledge accumulation
- Domain-specific context (work, personal, technical topics)
- Relationship dynamics and communication styles

### 4. Procedural Memory
Learned interaction patterns and successful strategies.
- Communication strategies that work for specific users
- Thread switching preferences and triggers
- Conversation flow patterns and timing
- Behavioral adaptations and response styles

## Key Features

### Local-First Architecture
- **No External Dependencies**: All memory processing happens locally
- **Embedded Databases**: Uses libSQL and ChromaDB for persistence
- **Privacy-First**: All personal data remains on user's device
- **Offline Capable**: Full functionality without internet connection

### Intelligent Thread Management
- **Automatic Thread Resolution**: Seamless conversation continuity without manual thread switching
- **Semantic Understanding**: Vector similarity analysis for topic coherence
- **Behavioral Learning**: Adapts to individual user conversation preferences
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation state across sessions

### Performance Optimized
- **Hardware Efficient**: Designed for consumer-grade hardware
- **Adaptive Resource Usage**: Scales performance based on available resources
- **Lazy Loading**: Loads context only when needed
- **Configurable Depth**: User-adjustable memory detail vs. performance trade-offs

## Implementation Strategy

The memory system implementation follows a phased approach, starting with essential session context and building toward full relationship intelligence:

### Phase 1: Session Context Management
- Basic conversation state persistence
- Simple thread continuation logic
- Working memory implementation
- Foundation for context assembly

### Phase 2: Semantic Thread Resolution
- Vector embedding integration
- Similarity-based thread matching
- Topic modeling and coherence detection
- Enhanced context retrieval

### Phase 3: Behavioral Learning
- User pattern recognition
- Adaptive threshold adjustment
- Cross-conversation knowledge building
- Personalized interaction strategies

### Phase 4: Advanced Relationship Intelligence
- Multi-modal context integration
- Predictive engagement triggers
- Complex relationship modeling
- Proactive initiative generation

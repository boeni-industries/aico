- Foundation context assembly framework (`shared/aico/ai/memory/context.py`)
- MemoryManager base implementation extending BaseAIProcessor

#### Deliverables
- **Session Continuity**: Conversations maintain context within active sessions
- **Basic Thread Management**: Simple time-based thread creation/continuation

### Phase 2: Semantic Thread Resolution (Intelligence)
**Priority**: After Phase 1 completion  
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Goal**: Intelligent thread switching based on content similarity

#### Deliverables
- **Semantic Thread Matching**: Content-based thread resolution
- **Vector Storage**: Efficient similarity search for thread matching
- **Topic Coherence**: Maintain conversation topics across sessions

- Enhanced database schema with embeddings

#### Phase 2 Implementation Notes:
- Episodic memory uses EncryptedLibSQLConnection following AICO patterns
- Semantic analysis requires lightweight embedding models for local processing
- ChromaDB provides vector storage with local persistence and fallback JSON storage
- Thread resolution integrates with existing ThreadManager service
- Performance remains viable on consumer hardware with proper model selection

### Phase 3: Behavioral Learning (Personalization)
**Priority**: After Phase 2 completion  
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks  
**Goal**: Learn user-specific conversation patterns and preferences

#### Deliverables
- **Personalized Thresholds**: User-specific decision parameters
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn individual conversation rhythms
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Continuous improvement based on user interactions
- **Preference Learning**: Understand user communication style preferences

#### Key Components
- User Behavior Analyzer for pattern recognition
- Adaptive Threshold Manager for dynamic adjustment
- User Conversation Profile system
- Feedback learning mechanisms

### Phase 4: Advanced Relationship Intelligence (Full System)
**Priority**: After Phase 3 completion  
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks  
**Goal**: Complete memory system with proactive capabilities

#### Deliverables
- **Complete Memory System**: All four memory tiers fully operational
- **Proactive Capabilities**: Initiative generation and engagement triggers
- **Relationship Intelligence**: Deep understanding of user relationships
- **Advanced Context**: Multi-modal context integration

#### Key Components
- Semantic Memory Builder for cross-conversation knowledge
- Proactive Engagement Engine for initiative generation
- Advanced relationship modeling
- Multi-modal context integration

## Migration Strategy

### Phase Transitions
1. **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: Add vector storage, maintain existing thread logic as fallback
2. **Phase 2 → Phase 3**: Add behavioral analysis, keep semantic resolution as primary
3. **Phase 3 → Phase 4**: Add advanced features, maintain all existing functionality

### Backward Compatibility
- Each phase maintains full compatibility with previous phases
- Graceful degradation when advanced features unavailable
- Configuration-driven feature enablement
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Configuration Evolution

### Phase 1 Configuration
```yaml
memory:
  working_memory:
    context_window_size: 10
    max_tokens: 4000
    persistence_interval: 30  # seconds
  
  thread_management:
    dormancy_threshold_hours: 2
    max_thread_age_days: 30
```

### Phase 2 Configuration
```yaml
memory:
  semantic_analysis:
    embedding_model: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
    similarity_threshold: 0.7
    max_dormant_threads: 10
    vector_storage_path: "data/memory/vectors"
```

### Phase 3 Configuration
```yaml
memory:
  behavioral_learning:
    learning_rate: 0.1
    adaptation_interval: 24  # hours
    min_interactions_for_learning: 10
    feedback_weight: 0.8
```

### Phase 4 Configuration
```yaml
memory:
  advanced_features:
    proactive_engagement: true
    cross_conversation_learning: true
    relationship_modeling: true
    multi_modal_context: true
```

## Hardware Adaptation Strategy

### Performance Modes
- **Minimal**: Phase 1 only, basic context management
- **Balanced**: Phases 1-2, semantic analysis with reduced models
- **Full**: All phases, complete feature set

### Resource Management
```yaml
hardware:
  performance_mode: "adaptive"  # minimal, balanced, full
  max_memory_mb: 500
  background_processing: true
  battery_aware: true
  
  # Adaptive thresholds based on available resources
  adaptive_thresholds:
    low_memory_fallback: "minimal"
    battery_saver_mode: "balanced"
    high_performance_mode: "full"
```

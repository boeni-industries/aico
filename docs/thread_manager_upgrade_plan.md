# üöÄ **AICO Thread Manager Upgrade Plan**

## **Executive Summary**

The current thread manager has critical flaws causing conversation fragmentation. This plan outlines a complete upgrade to a next-generation system using modern AI techniques.

## **üö® Current Issues Analysis**

### **Critical Problems**
1. **Exception-Driven Fragmentation**: ANY database error creates new threads
2. **Brittle Dependencies**: Complex initialization chain with single points of failure  
3. **Primitive Logic**: Only 2-hour time threshold, no semantic analysis
4. **Missing Persistence**: No actual database integration (TODO comments)
5. **No Context Awareness**: Ignores conversation flow, topic shifts, user intent

### **Impact on User Experience**
- ‚ùå Conversations split across multiple threads
- ‚ùå Context loss between messages
- ‚ùå Poor memory performance (entities scattered)
- ‚ùå Inconsistent AI responses
- ‚ùå Evaluation framework shows 0% entity extraction

## **üß† Modern Thread Management Research**

### **Industry Best Practices**
1. **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: ChatHistoryReducer with intelligent summarization
2. **Slack/Discord**: Thread branching with semantic clustering
3. **Vector Similarity**: Embedding-based thread matching
4. **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Temporal + Semantic + Behavioral + Intent

### **Key Innovations**
- **Markovian Context**: Recent messages weighted higher
- **Robust Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation without context loss
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, async processing
- **User Behavior Learning**: Adaptive thread management

## **üèóÔ∏è Proposed Architecture**

### **Core Components**

#### **1. Multi-Factor Thread Resolution**
```python
ThreadResolution = f(
    temporal_continuity,      # Time since last activity
    semantic_similarity,      # Vector embedding similarity  
    intent_alignment,         # Intent classification match
    entity_overlap,          # Named entity overlap
    conversation_flow,       # Question-answer patterns
    user_behavior_patterns   # Learned user preferences
)
```

#### **2. Robust Service Layer**
- **Embedding Service**: Vector similarity calculations
- **Intent Classifier**: Conversation intent detection
- **Entity Extractor**: Integration with existing AICO NER
- **Working Store**: Reliable database access with fallbacks

#### **3. Thread Lifecycle Management**
- **Creation**: New conversations, topic shifts
- **Continuation**: Semantic similarity + temporal proximity
- **Branching**: Topic shifts within active conversations
- **Merging**: Related thread consolidation
- **Archival**: Long-term storage and cleanup

#### **4. Performance Optimization**
- **Caching**: Thread contexts, embeddings, user patterns
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient database queries
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures

    analysis = analyze_message(message)
    
    # 2. Get candidate threads
    candidates = get_user_threads(user_id, limit=10)
    
    # 3. Score each candidate
    scores = {}
    for thread in candidates:
        scores[thread.id] = {
            'semantic': cosine_similarity(analysis.embedding, thread.embedding),
            'temporal': temporal_score(thread.last_activity),
            'intent': intent_alignment(analysis.intent, thread.intents),
            'entity': entity_overlap(analysis.entities, thread.entities),
            'flow': conversation_flow_score(analysis, thread),
            'behavior': user_pattern_match(analysis, thread, user_patterns)
        }
    
    # 4. Apply weighted decision matrix
    best_thread = apply_decision_matrix(scores, thresholds)
    
    # 5. Return resolution with confidence and reasoning
    return ThreadResolution(
        thread_id=best_thread.id,
        action=determine_action(best_thread, scores),
        confidence=calculate_confidence(scores),
        reasoning=generate_reasoning(scores, thresholds)
    )

# AICO Command-Line Interface (CLI) Architecture

## Overview

The `aico` CLI provides a professional, cross-platform, and high-performance command-line tool for administering, automating, and interacting with the AICO system. It is designed for power users, system administrators, and developers who require advanced control, scripting, and diagnostic capabilities beyond the graphical admin UI.

## Goals & Principles

- **Universal Accessibility:** The CLI is callable from anywhere on the system after installation, with no dependency on virtual environments or fragile path setup.
- **Top-Tier UX:** Fast startup, instant command responses, user-friendly and visually appealing output, modern Unicode/emoji support, and rich progress indicators.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs natively and identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **DRY & KISS:** Shares business logic and data models with backend services, avoiding code duplication and maximizing maintainability.
- **Extensible:** Modular command structure for future expansion.

## Technology Choices

### Implementation Language
- **Python**
  - Rationale: Shares language and libraries with backend, enables DRY integration, mature ecosystem for CLI development and packaging, cross-platform by default.

### Core Libraries
- **Typer**: Modern CLI framework (built on Click) for intuitive, maintainable, and autocompleting command trees.
- **Rich**: Advanced text formatting, tables, syntax highlighting, progress bars, and beautiful output. All advanced UX is implemented directly using Rich in our own code.
- **PyInstaller**: For building a single-file, dependency-free, universal executable for all platforms. (Briefcase is not used.)
- **httpx**: Modern, async-capable HTTP client for API communication with backend services.
- **ZeroMQ** (via `pyzmq`): For direct message bus integration when required.
- **Platformdirs**: For managing config/cache paths in a cross-platform manner.

### Packaging & Distribution
- **PyPI Distribution** (primary):
    - Professional Python package distribution via `pip`, `pipx`, or `uv tool install`.
    - Fast startup (~0.2s vs 7.3s PyInstaller overhead).
    - Requires Python 3.9+ on target system.
    - Cross-platform: identical installation and usage on Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **PyInstaller** (legacy):
    - Single-file executable approach (deprecated due to slow startup).
    - Kept for reference but no longer recommended.

## Integration Approach

- **Backend Integration:**
    - CLI imports and reuses backend Python modules for admin logic where possible (e.g., user management, diagnostics, data migration).
    - For remote administration, CLI communicates with backend via REST API or ZeroMQ, using shared schemas and models.
    - All business logic is implemented in backend modules, not duplicated in CLI code.
- **Frontend/UI Integration:**
    - CLI may offer commands to launch or interact with the admin UI (e.g., `aico admin open`), but does not duplicate UI logic.
    - Main CLI use cases are backend/admin-focused.

## Command Structure (Example)

```
aico [command] [options]

Commands:
  version        Manage and synchronize versions across all AICO system parts
  security       Master password setup and security management
  db             Database initialization, status, and management
  ...            (future: plugin, logs, config, admin, etc.)
```

- Each command is implemented as a Typer sub-app, allowing modular growth.
- All output uses Rich for tables, markdown, progress bars, and error highlighting.

## CLI Architecture

> **Permanent CLI UX Policy:**
> 
> All CLI commands and command groups must provide actionable, friendly, and instructive feedback when invoked incorrectly or incompletely. The CLI must never:
> - Show only an aggressive error message
> - Require the user to consult help and then retry
> - Leave the user without a clear next step
>
> Instead, every CLI entrypoint must print helpful guidance, usage examples, and (where possible) a preview of the result. This is a strict and permanent requirement for all CLI development in AICO.

## Visual Style Guide

### Design Philosophy

The AICO CLI follows a **modern, minimal, clean** aesthetic that prioritizes:
- **Readability** over decoration
- **Consistency** across all commands
- **Professional appearance** suitable for enterprise environments
- **Accessibility** across different terminals and color schemes

### Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**
- **Cyan (`[bold cyan]`)**: Brand color for titles, headers, and AICO branding
- **Yellow (`[bold yellow]`)**: Table headers and section labels
- **Green (`[green]`, `[bold green]`)**: Success states, version numbers, positive values
- **Red (`[red]`)**: Errors, warnings, missing values
- **White (`[bold white]`)**: Primary content, subsystem names
- **Dim (`[dim]`)**: Secondary information, examples, help text

**Usage Guidelines:**
```python
# Titles and branding
console.print("‚ú® [bold cyan]AICO System Versions[/bold cyan]")

# Table headers
header_style="bold yellow"

# Success/positive values
v = f"[bold green]{version}[/bold green]"

# Errors
console.print(f"‚ùå [red]Error message[/red]")

# Secondary info
console.print("[dim]Use 'aico COMMAND --help' for more information.[/dim]")
```

### Typography & Formatting

**Text Hierarchy:**
1. **Titles**: `[bold cyan]` with optional sparkle emoji (‚ú®)
2. **Headers**: `[bold yellow]` for section headers and table columns
3. **Content**: `[bold white]` for primary data, `[green]` for values
4. **Help Text**: `[dim]` for examples and guidance

**Spacing Rules:**
- Always add blank lines before and after tables/panels
- Use `console.rule()` for section dividers in complex output
- Consistent padding in tables: `padding=(0, 1)`

### Table Styling

**Standard Table Configuration:**
```python
table = Table(
    title="‚ú® [bold cyan]Title Here[/bold cyan]",
    title_style="bold cyan",
    border_style="bright_blue",
    header_style="bold yellow",
    show_lines=False,
    box=box.SIMPLE_HEAD,
    padding=(0, 1)
)
```

**Critical Rules:**
- **NO EMOJIS IN TABLE DATA**: Emojis break column alignment across terminals
- **Use `box.SIMPLE_HEAD`**: Clean, minimal borders that align properly
- **Left-align all columns**: `justify="left"` for consistency
- **Consistent column styling**: `style="bold white"` for labels, `style="green"` for values

### Icons & Symbols

**Approved Icons:**
- ‚ú® Sparkle: Titles and branding
- ‚ùå Cross: Errors and failures
- üì¶ Package: Generic items (fallback only)
- ‚ö° Lightning: CLI/command line tools (in panels only)
- ü§ñ Robot: AI/backend services (in panels only)
- üñ•Ô∏è Monitor: UI/frontend (in panels only)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Gear: Configuration/admin (in panels only)

**Icon Usage Rules:**
- **Tables**: NO icons in table data (alignment issues)
- **Panels**: Icons OK for single-item displays
- **Titles**: Sparkle (‚ú®) only
- **Errors**: Cross (‚ùå) with red text

### Panel Styling

**For single-item displays:**
```python
panel = Panel(
    f"{icon} [bold white]{item}[/bold white]\n[bold green]{value}[/bold green]",
    title="[bold cyan]Title[/bold cyan]",
    border_style="bright_blue",
    box=box.ROUNDED,
    padding=(1, 2)
)
```

### Layout Patterns

**Root CLI Help:**
```python
console.print("\n‚ú® [bold cyan]AICO CLI[/bold cyan]")
console.print("[dim]Description here[/dim]\n")
console.rule("[bold blue]Section Name", style="blue")
console.print("\nüì¶ [green]command[/green]   Description")
```

**Command Group Help:**
- Use Typer's built-in help system with comprehensive help strings
- Include examples and usage guidance in help text
- Show help automatically when no subcommand given (not errors)

### Implementation Guidelines for Developers

1. **Always use the approved color palette** - no custom colors
2. **Never put emojis in table data** - breaks alignment
3. **Use `box.SIMPLE_HEAD` for all tables** - consistent, clean appearance
4. **Include sparkle (‚ú®) in main titles** - brand consistency
5. **Left-align all table columns** - professional appearance
6. **Add spacing around tables/panels** - breathing room
7. **Use `[dim]` for help text** - visual hierarchy

### Anti-Patterns (DO NOT USE)

‚ùå **Emojis in table rows** (breaks alignment)  
‚ùå **Center-aligned table columns** (inconsistent)  
‚ùå **Rounded table borders** (alignment issues)  
‚ùå **Custom colors outside palette** (inconsistent branding)  
‚ùå **Missing spacing around tables** (cramped appearance)  
‚ùå **Aggressive error messages** (violates UX policy)  
‚ùå **Complex box styles** (maintenance burden)  

This style guide ensures all CLI commands maintain the same professional, clean, minimal aesthetic that users expect from the AICO system.


### Core Principles
- **Modular & Extensible**: Each command is a self-contained module/sub-app, enabling massive future growth.
- **DRY & Maintainable**: Shares logic with backend modules; CLI is a thin, UX-focused layer.
- **Fast & User-Friendly**: Instant startup, rich output, robust error handling, and autocompletion.
- **Self-Documenting**: Any incomplete or ambiguous command invocation yields a helpful, predictive help text to guide the user to the next step.

### CLI Directory Structure (Suggested)

```text
/cli  
    /commands  
        status.py  
        user.py  
        db.py  
        plugin.py  
        logs.py  
        config.py  
        admin.py  
        version.py   # (First: versioning automation)  
    main.py  
    utils.py  
    ...
```
- Each command is implemented as a sub-app (using Typer) and registered in `main.py`.
- Shared utilities, config, and backend integration in `utils.py` or `/lib`.

### Command Registration Pattern

```python
# main.py
import typer
from commands import status, user, db, plugin, logs, config, admin, version

app = typer.Typer()
app.add_typer(version.app, name="version")
# ...add other sub-apps

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
```

### Growth & Extensibility
- Each new domain (e.g., plugin, agent, emotion, vector) gets its own command module.
- The sub-app pattern keeps the CLI scalable and organized as it grows.
- Future plugin discovery (dynamic loading) can be added as CLI matures.

## UX & Output Standards

- **Instant startup** (<100ms typical)
- **Colorful, readable output** with Unicode, emoji, and clear formatting
- **Progress bars** for long-running tasks
- **Context-aware help** and autocompletion
- **Graceful error handling** and actionable messages
- **Consistent cross-platform behavior**

## Building the Universal Executable

1. **Install dependencies:**
    - All CLI dependencies are specified in `requirements-cli.txt`.
2. **Build with PyInstaller:**
    - Example: `pyinstaller --onefile aico_cli/main.py --name aico`
    - Produces `aico.exe` (Windows), `aico` (Linux/macOS)
    - Test on all platforms for startup speed and compatibility
3. **Distribution:**
    - Distribute the single executable via release, package manager, or installer
    - No Python or .venv required on user system

## Security Considerations

- CLI commands requiring elevated privileges (e.g., user management) prompt for authentication as needed
- All remote operations are encrypted (HTTPS, ZeroMQ with CURVE, etc.)
- CLI never stores credentials in plaintext

## Future-Proofing & Extensibility

- Modular command loading for plugin/extension support
- Easy to add new commands as backend expands
- Consistent with AICO's local-first, privacy-preserving philosophy

## Best Practices for CLI Speed & Responsiveness

- **Minimize startup imports:** Import heavy libraries only inside functions/commands, not at the top-level.
- **Lazy-load features:** Only load modules and data when a command is actually invoked.
- **Avoid unnecessary I/O:** Defer config, network, or database access until needed.
- **Keep main() lightweight:** The entrypoint should do as little as possible before dispatching to commands.
- **Profile regularly:** Use timing tools to identify and fix slow paths.
- **Batch backend/API calls:** Where possible, reduce round-trips and use bulk operations.
- **Cache where safe:** Cache static or infrequently changing data in memory for the session.
- **Test on all platforms:** Verify speed and behavior on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Command Groups

### Version Commands (`aico version`)
Manages and synchronizes versioning across all major AICO system parts from a single source of truth.

**Architecture**: Uses centralized `VERSIONS` file as canonical source, with automatic propagation to individual component version files and git tagging.

### Security Commands (`aico security`)
Manages master password setup and security operations for AICO's encrypted data layer.

**Architecture**: Uses `AICOKeyManager` for unified key management across all database types with secure keyring integration. Session-based authentication with decorator-enforced security for sensitive operations.

#### Decorator-Based Security Classification

The CLI uses decorators to automatically enforce authentication requirements:

**üîê Sensitive Commands** (`@sensitive` decorator - require fresh authentication):
- `security passwd` - Change master password
- `security clear` - Clear credentials  
- `logs export` - Export sensitive log data
- `config export` - Export sensitive configuration

**‚ö†Ô∏è Dangerous Commands** (`@destructive` decorator - require fresh authentication):
- `db exec` - Execute arbitrary SQL (allows DROP, DELETE, UPDATE)
- `db vacuum` - Rebuild database structure (risk of data loss if interrupted)

**‚úÖ Regular Commands** (no decorators - use session cache):
- `db status`, `db ls`, `db test` - Read-only database operations
- `security session` - Show session information
- `config show` - Display configuration

**üöÄ Setup Commands** (no decorators - no authentication required):
- `security setup` - Initial password creation
- `db init` - Database initialization

This decorator approach provides:
- **Zero developer hell**: Easy to add/remove security requirements
- **Automatic enforcement**: Authentication handled transparently
- **Clear semantics**: Command purpose obvious from decorator
- **Audit logging**: Sensitive operations automatically logged

### Database Commands (`aico db`)
Manages encrypted database initialization and operations.

**Architecture**: Supports multiple database types with type-specific encryption (PBKDF2 for LibSQL, Argon2id for others). Automatic salt management and transparent encryption. Includes comprehensive CRUD testing with proper transaction management to prevent libSQL safety conflicts.

### Integration Pattern
Security and database commands integrate through `AICOKeyManager` providing derived keys to database connections. Master password affects all databases; database operations are type-specific.

**For detailed usage examples and workflows, see the [CLI Handbook](../developer-guide/cli_handbook.md).**

## Performance Characteristics

The AICO CLI is optimized for fast startup and responsive operation:

- **Startup time**: ~0.2s (compared to 7.3s with legacy PyInstaller)
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Identical performance on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Memory footprint**: Minimal - only loads required dependencies per command
- **Development workflow**: Instant code changes with editable installation

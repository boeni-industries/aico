# Architecture

!!! info "In Development"
    AICO's architecture documentation will be added as the system design evolves.

## System Overview

AICO is designed as a local-first AI companion with the following core principles:

- **Modular Design**: Separate components for core modules
- **Privacy-First**: Local (edge) processing where possible, with user-controlled data sharing
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for customization and expansion
- **Real-time**: Low-latency interaction for natural conversation flow

## Core Components

*Detailed component documentation will be added as they are implemented:*

- **Personality Engine**: Dynamic personality modeling and adaptation
- **Emotion Recognition**: Multi-modal emotion detection (visual, audio, text)
- **Memory System**: Episodic and semantic memory management
- **Interaction Manager**: Conversation flow and proactive behavior
- **Privacy Controller**: Data governance and user consent management

## Architecture Diagrams

*System diagrams will be added here as the architecture is finalized.*

## Technical Stack

*Technology choices and rationale will be documented as decisions are made.*

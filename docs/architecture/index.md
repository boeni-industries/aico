# Architecture

## Project Summary

AICO is an open-source experiment to build an **emotionally present, embodied, and proactive AI companion**‚Äîmeant to act as more of a confidante and sidekick than a traditional assistant. Unlike typical productivity-oriented virtual assistants, AICO is designed to sense and adapt to the user's moods, initiate engagement, and form an evolving, personality-rich relationship.

**Core Principles:**
- **Autonomous agency** - AICO has its own goals, interests, and curiosities that drive self-directed behavior and learning
- **Strong user-centric privacy** - Local-first with full user control
- **Modular, extensible architecture** - Prioritizes companionship and long-term learning
- **Real-time emotional awareness** - Multi-modal emotion recognition and adaptation

## System Architecture

AICO follows a **modular, message-driven architecture** designed for local-first privacy, extensibility, and autonomous behavior. The system is organized into modules containing related components that communicate through a central message bus, enabling loose coupling and real-time, event-driven interactions.

### Core Design Principles

#### üè† Local-First by Default
All personal data and core inference runs locally (PC, workstation, or powerful edge device). Only opt-in features use cloud or edge APIs when stronger compute is required.

#### üì¶ Containerized Modules
Each subsystem (personality engine, memory, emotion recognition) runs as a separate service or container (Docker, Podman). This enables:
- Platform flexibility
- Easy updates
- Strict isolation for privacy
- Independent scaling

#### üåê Unified API Gateway
A local gRPC or HTTP API combines all modules. All frontends (avatar, chat, desktop widget, AR/VR) communicate through this unified interface.

#### üîå Plugin System
Expose a plugin interface for community extensions (skills, connectors, UI themes) in scripting languages (Python, Node.js).

#### üîí Privacy Controller
Central user-governed dashboard for:
- Toggling features
- Controlling cloud data sharing
- Data lifecycle management
- Audit logging

## Autonomous Agency Architecture

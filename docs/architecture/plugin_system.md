# Plugin System

## Overview

The Plugin System is a core infrastructure component of AICO that enables extensibility through third-party modules while maintaining the system's security, privacy, and stability principles. It allows developers to create custom capabilities that integrate with AICO's core functionality without modifying the base system.

The Plugin System follows AICO's modular architecture and message-driven design, providing a secure sandbox environment for plugin execution while mediating access to system resources and the message bus.

## Design Principles

The Plugin System architecture is built on the following key principles:

### 1. Secure Isolation

Plugins operate in isolated sandbox environments to:
- Prevent unauthorized access to system resources
- Protect user data and privacy
- Ensure system stability by containing plugin failures
- Enforce resource usage limits

### 2. Controlled Integration

All plugin interactions with AICO occur through controlled channels:
- Mediated access to the message bus
- Permission-based access control for system resources
- Explicit capability grants rather than implicit access
- Versioned APIs for stable integration

### 3. Hot-Loading Capability

Plugins can be dynamically loaded and unloaded without system restarts:
- Runtime installation and activation
- Graceful deactivation and removal
- State preservation during updates
- Version compatibility checking

### 4. Developer Experience

The Plugin System prioritizes a positive developer experience:
- Clear, well-documented APIs
- Comprehensive SDK with development tools
- Streamlined testing and debugging workflows
- Simplified packaging and distribution

### 5. User Control

Users maintain full control over plugins:
- Granular permission management
- Transparency about plugin capabilities and data access
- Ability to enable/disable individual plugins
- Performance and resource usage monitoring

## Architecture Components

### Plugin Manager

The Plugin Manager is the central component responsible for:
- Plugin lifecycle management (installation, activation, deactivation, uninstallation)
- Enforcing security policies and access controls
- Resource allocation and monitoring
- Plugin discovery and metadata management
- Version compatibility verification

### Plugin Sandbox

Each plugin runs within a dedicated sandbox that:
- Isolates plugin code execution
- Controls access to system resources
- Monitors resource usage (CPU, memory, network)
- Enforces timeout and rate limits
- Provides controlled access to permitted APIs

### Plugin Gateway

The Plugin Gateway mediates all communication between plugins and AICO's core systems:
- Message bus access control
- API request validation and routing
- Event subscription management
- Resource access mediation

### Plugin Registry

The Plugin Registry maintains information about available and installed plugins:
- Plugin metadata and capabilities
- Version information and compatibility
- User-configured settings and permissions
- Usage statistics and health metrics

### Plugin SDK

The Plugin SDK provides developers with tools for creating plugins:
- API client libraries
- Development templates and examples
- Local testing environment
- Documentation and tutorials
- Packaging and distribution tools

## Plugin Integration with Message Bus

Plugins integrate with AICO's core functionality primarily through the message bus, as described in the [Message Bus Architecture](message_bus.md) document. The Plugin Manager mediates this integration through:

### 1. Topic Access Control

- Plugins request access to specific message topics
- The Plugin Manager enforces access policies based on plugin permissions
- Unauthorized topic access attempts are blocked and logged
- Access can be granted at different levels (publish-only, subscribe-only, or both)

### 2. Message Validation

- All messages from plugins are validated against schema definitions
- Malformed messages are rejected before entering the message bus
- Rate limiting prevents message flooding
- Message size limits are enforced

### 3. Topic Namespacing

- Plugins publish to namespaced topics (e.g., `plugin.{plugin_id}.{topic}`)
- Core system components can subscribe to plugin topics selectively
- Plugin-to-plugin communication is controlled through explicit permissions

### 4. Message Transformation

- The Plugin Gateway can transform messages between plugin-specific and system formats
- Version compatibility is maintained through message adaptation
- Sensitive data can be filtered or anonymized

## Plugin Lifecycle

### 1. Discovery and Installation

- Plugins can be discovered through the AICO marketplace or local files
- Installation process includes:
  - Verification of digital signatures
  - Compatibility checking
  - Dependency resolution
  - Resource requirement validation
  - User permission confirmation

### 2. Activation

- User explicitly activates a plugin
- Plugin sandbox is initialized
- Required resources are allocated
- Plugin connects to the message bus through the Plugin Gateway
- Initialization hooks are called

### 3. Operation

- Plugin runs within its sandbox
- Interacts with AICO through the message bus and approved APIs
- Resource usage is continuously monitored
- Performance metrics are collected

### 4. Deactivation

- User deactivates plugin or system triggers deactivation
- Plugin receives deactivation signal
- Cleanup hooks are called
- Resources are released
- Plugin state is preserved for future activation

### 5. Uninstallation

- User initiates uninstallation
- Plugin is deactivated if active
- Plugin files and data are removed
- System registry is updated

### 6. Updates

- New version is discovered
- Update verification process runs
- Current version is deactivated
- New version is installed
- State migration occurs if supported
- New version is activated

# P2P Mesh Network

AICO's P2P mesh network enables **distributed AI companionship** - allowing your AI companion to maintain continuity and presence across multiple devices while preserving privacy and local control. The architecture prioritizes **relationship continuity** over technical efficiency, ensuring that AICO feels like the same companion regardless of which device you're using.

## Design Philosophy

The P2P mesh serves three fundamental goals for AI companionship:

1. **Seamless Roaming**: Your relationship with AICO continues uninterrupted as you move between devices
2. **Privacy Preservation**: Personal data stays within your device network, never requiring external cloud services
3. **Resilient Presence**: AICO remains available even when individual devices are offline or disconnected

**Local-First with Federation**: Each device operates independently but can share context and memories with trusted devices in your personal network.

### Relationship-Centric Design

The mesh network is designed around **personal device families** rather than generic distributed systems. Each device in your network knows about and trusts other devices, creating a **private AI ecosystem**.

**Trust Boundaries**: The network distinguishes between your personal devices (full trust), family devices (selective sharing), and external devices (no access). This enables privacy-preserving AI companionship.

**Adaptive Topology**: Devices automatically discover and connect to each other, but the user always controls which devices can join the family network.

## ZeroMQ Communication Strategy

### Unified Internal and External Messaging

ZeroMQ serves as both the **internal message bus** within each device and the **inter-device communication layer**. This unified approach ensures consistent behavior whether AICO is processing local requests or coordinating across devices.

**Design Rationale**: Using the same messaging patterns internally and externally simplifies development and ensures that distributed operations feel as responsive as local ones.

### Transport Layer Adaptation

#### Local Communication (Intra-Device)
**IPC Transport** for maximum efficiency within a single device. All AICO modules communicate through the same message bus, enabling loose coupling and easy extensibility.

```python
# High-speed local communication
INTERNAL_ENDPOINT = "ipc:///tmp/aico-bus"
```

**Benefits**: Zero network overhead, automatic process isolation, consistent message patterns across all modules.

#### Network Communication (Inter-Device)
**TCP Transport with CurveZMQ encryption** for secure device-to-device communication. Every network message is encrypted end-to-end, ensuring privacy even on untrusted networks.

```python
# Secure network communication
P2P_ENDPOINT = "tcp://*:5555"
```

**Security First**: All inter-device communication uses public-key cryptography, ensuring that only trusted devices can participate in your AI companion network.

### Communication Patterns for AI Companionship

#### Request-Reply: Direct Device Coordination

**Use Case**: When one device needs specific information from another - like retrieving a memory that's stored on your desktop while using your phone.

**Synchronous by Design**: Some operations require immediate responses to maintain conversation flow. Request-reply ensures that AICO can access any information in your device network without noticeable delay.

```python
# Example: Retrieving specific memory from another device
request = {
    "type": "memory_search",
    "query": "conversation about vacation plans",
    "timestamp": time.time()
}
```

**Reliability**: Built-in timeout and retry logic ensures that temporary network issues don't break the AI companion experience.

#### Publisher-Subscriber: Emotional State Sharing

**Use Case**: Broadcasting AICO's emotional state changes across all devices so the UI can respond consistently everywhere.

**Real-Time Presence**: When AICO's mood shifts or personality expression changes, all connected devices receive immediate updates, maintaining consistent AI presence.

```python
# Example: Sharing emotional state across devices
topic = "emotion.state_change"
message = {
    "device_id": device_id,
    "emotional_context": "user_mentioned_work_stress",
    "valence_shift": -0.2  # Became more concerned
}
```

**Design Philosophy**: Emotional updates are broadcast rather than requested because AI companionship requires proactive emotional awareness.

#### Push-Pull: Distributed AI Processing

**Use Case**: Distributing computationally intensive AI tasks (like semantic search or emotion analysis) across available devices in your network.

**Load Balancing**: Automatically distributes work to the most capable available device, whether that's your desktop GPU or a cloud instance you control.

```python
# Example: Distributing vector search across devices
task = {
    "type": "semantic_search",
    "query": "memories about family gatherings",
    "priority": "user_initiated"  # Higher priority than background tasks
}
```

**Adaptive Processing**: Tasks automatically route to devices with appropriate capabilities - vector searches go to devices with good CPUs/GPUs, while simple queries stay local.

### Topic Organization for AI Relationships

#### Device Management Topics

Topics organized around **family network management** rather than technical device administration.

```
device/
├── discovery/announce     # "I'm a new AICO device"
├── discovery/response     # "I recognize you, let's connect"
├── registry/update        # "My capabilities have changed"
├── registry/query         # "What devices are in our family?"
└── heartbeat             # "I'm still here and available"
```

**Human-Centric Naming**: Topic names reflect the relationship aspect - devices "announce" themselves like family members, rather than just broadcasting technical information.

#### Synchronization Topics

Topics focused on **maintaining AI companion continuity** across devices.

```
sync/
├── data/request          # "I need recent conversation history"
├── data/response         # "Here's what you missed"
├── conflict/detected     # "We have different versions of this memory"
├── conflict/resolved     # "We've agreed on the correct version"
└── status/update         # "Sync completed successfully"
```

**Conflict Resolution**: Explicit topics for handling disagreements between devices about memories or conversation history, ensuring AICO's consistency.

#### AI Companion Topics

Topics that directly support the **human-AI relationship** rather than technical operations.

```
conversation/
├── message/user          # User said something
├── message/assistant     # AICO responded
├── context/update        # Conversation topic or mood shifted
└── history/sync          # Sharing conversation history

emotion/
├── state/current         # AICO's current emotional state
├── state/history         # Emotional patterns over time
├── analysis/request      # "Analyze this interaction emotionally"
└── analysis/result       # Emotional insights and patterns

memory/
├── store/request         # "Remember this important moment"
├── search/request        # "Find memories about X"
├── search/result         # Relevant memories found
└── sync/update          # Sharing memories across devices
```

**Relationship-Focused Design**: Each topic represents a meaningful aspect of AI companionship - emotional awareness, memory sharing, conversation continuity.

## Device Discovery

### mDNS/Bonjour Discovery

#### Service Advertisement
```python
# Advertise AICO service on local network
service_info = ServiceInfo(
    type_="_aico._tcp.local.",
    name=f"{device_name}._aico._tcp.local.",
    addresses=[socket.inet_aton(local_ip)],
    port=5555,
    properties={
        'version': '1.0.0',
        'capabilities': 'sync,federation',
        'device_type': 'backend',
        'public_key': base64.b64encode(public_key).decode()
    }
)
zeroconf.register_service(service_info)
```

#### Service Discovery
```python
class AICOServiceListener:
    def add_service(self, zeroconf, type, name):
        info = zeroconf.get_service_info(type, name)
        if info:
            device_info = {
                'name': name,
                'address': socket.inet_ntoa(info.addresses[0]),
                'port': info.port,
                'properties': info.properties
            }
            self.discovered_devices.append(device_info)
```

### DHT Network Discovery

#### Distributed Hash Table
```python
# Kademlia DHT for wide-area discovery
from kademlia.network import Server

# Bootstrap DHT node
server = Server()
await server.listen(8468)
await server.bootstrap([("bootstrap.aico.network", 8468)])

# Store device information
device_key = f"aico:device:{device_id}"
device_info = {
    'endpoints': ['tcp://192.168.1.100:5555'],
    'public_key': public_key_hex,
    'capabilities': ['sync', 'federation'],
    'last_seen': time.time()
}
await server.set(device_key, json.dumps(device_info))
```

#### Device Lookup
```python
# Find devices by capability
async def find_devices_with_capability(capability):
    devices = []
    # Query DHT for devices with specific capability
    for device_id in known_device_ids:
        key = f"aico:device:{device_id}"
        data = await server.get(key)
        if data and capability in json.loads(data).get('capabilities', []):
            devices.append(json.loads(data))
    return devices
```

### Manual Configuration

#### Static Device Registry
```yaml
# config/devices.yaml
devices:
  - id: "device-001"
    name: "Home Desktop"
    endpoints:
      - "tcp://192.168.1.100:5555"
      - "tcp://home.example.com:5555"
    public_key: "curve_public_key_base64"
    capabilities: ["sync", "federation", "storage"]
    
  - id: "device-002" 
    name: "Mobile Phone"
    endpoints:
      - "tcp://192.168.1.101:5555"
    public_key: "curve_public_key_base64"
    capabilities: ["sync", "roaming"]
```

## Encryption & Security

### CurveZMQ Implementation

#### Key Generation
```python
import zmq.auth
from zmq.auth.thread import ThreadAuthenticator

# Generate long-term keypairs
server_public, server_secret = zmq.curve_keypair()
client_public, client_secret = zmq.curve_keypair()

# Store keys securely
keyring.set_password("aico", "curve_secret", server_secret.decode())
```

#### Server Configuration
```python
# Configure CurveZMQ server
socket = context.socket(zmq.REP)
socket.curve_secretkey = server_secret
socket.curve_publickey = server_public
socket.curve_server = True
socket.bind("tcp://*:5555")

# Start authenticator
auth = ThreadAuthenticator(context)
auth.start()
auth.configure_curve(domain='*', location=zmq.auth.CURVE_ALLOW_ANY)
```

#### Client Configuration
```python
# Configure CurveZMQ client
socket = context.socket(zmq.REQ)
socket.curve_secretkey = client_secret
socket.curve_publickey = client_public
socket.curve_serverkey = server_public  # Server's public key
socket.connect("tcp://server-ip:5555")
```

### Message Encryption

#### End-to-End Encryption
```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

class SecureMessage:
    def __init__(self, shared_key):
        self.cipher = Fernet(shared_key)
    
    def encrypt_message(self, message):
        return {
            'encrypted': self.cipher.encrypt(json.dumps(message).encode()),
            'timestamp': time.time(),
            'sender_id': self.device_id
        }
    
    def decrypt_message(self, encrypted_message):
        decrypted = self.cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message['encrypted'])
        return json.loads(decrypted.decode())
```

#### Key Exchange Protocol
```python
# ECDH key exchange for session keys
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.hkdf import HKDF

def perform_key_exchange(peer_public_key):
    # Generate ephemeral keypair
    private_key = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP256R1())
    public_key = private_key.public_key()
    
    # Perform ECDH
    shared_key = private_key.exchange(ec.ECDH(), peer_public_key)
    
    # Derive session key
    derived_key = HKDF(
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        length=32,
        salt=None,
        info=b'aico-session-key',
    ).derive(shared_key)
    
    return derived_key
```

## Federation Strategy for AI Companions

### Family Device Registry

**Relationship-Centric Device Management**: The device registry organizes devices around their role in your AI companion relationship rather than technical specifications.

#### Device Identity Model

```python
@dataclass
class FamilyDevice:
    device_id: str
    friendly_name: str           # "Dad's Laptop", "Kitchen Tablet"
    companion_role: str          # 'primary', 'mobile', 'shared', 'guest'
    ai_capabilities: List[str]   # ['conversation', 'memory', 'emotion']
    relationship_context: str    # 'personal', 'family', 'work'
    trust_level: str            # 'full', 'limited', 'guest'
    sync_preferences: Dict      # What data to share
```

**Human-Friendly Identification**: Devices are identified by meaningful names and roles rather than technical IDs, making family network management intuitive.

**Capability-Based Organization**: Devices are organized by their AI capabilities rather than hardware specifications, enabling intelligent task routing.

#### Family Network Synchronization

**Gossip-Based Discovery**: Devices share information about other family devices they know about, enabling automatic family network discovery without central coordination.

**Trust Propagation**: When a trusted device vouches for a new device, that recommendation is considered in trust decisions, simplifying family network expansion.

```python
async def sync_family_network():
    for trusted_device in get_family_devices():
        # Ask family devices about other devices they know
        family_update = await request_family_updates(trusted_device)
        
        # Evaluate new devices based on family recommendations
        for new_device in family_update.get('recommended_devices', []):
            if evaluate_family_trust(new_device, trusted_device):
                invite_to_family_network(new_device)
```

**Privacy-Preserving Updates**: Registry synchronization only shares device capabilities and connection information, never personal data or conversation content.

### Selective Data Sharing

#### Privacy-First Sync Policies

**User-Controlled Data Sharing**: Users control exactly what aspects of their AI relationship are shared across devices, with sensible defaults that prioritize privacy.

**Relationship-Aware Policies**: Sync policies are based on the nature of AI companion data rather than technical data types.

```python
class AICompanionSyncPolicy:
    def __init__(self):
        # What aspects of AI relationship to share
        self.conversation_continuity = True    # Share recent conversations
        self.emotional_awareness = True        # Share AICO's emotional state
        self.memory_access = True             # Share important memories
        self.personality_consistency = False   # Keep personality adaptations local
        
        # Privacy boundaries
        self.private_conversation_tags = ['personal', 'confidential']
        self.memory_privacy_levels = ['public', 'family']  # Exclude 'private'
        self.sync_time_window = timedelta(days=7)  # Only recent data
    
    def should_share_with_device(self, data_type: str, data: Dict, target_device: FamilyDevice) -> bool:
        # Respect device trust level and relationship context
        if target_device.trust_level == 'guest':
            return False  # Guests don't get AI companion data
        
        if data_type == 'conversation':
            return self._should_share_conversation(data, target_device)
        elif data_type == 'memory':
            return self._should_share_memory(data, target_device)
        
        return False
```

**Context-Sensitive Sharing**: Different devices receive different levels of AI companion information based on their role and the user's relationship with that device.

#### Intelligent Conflict Resolution

**AI Companion Continuity**: When devices have different versions of AI companion data, the system resolves conflicts in ways that maintain relationship authenticity.

**Context-Aware Resolution**: Conflicts are resolved based on the nature of AI companion interactions rather than simple technical rules.

```python
class AICompanionConflictResolver:
    def resolve_conversation_conflict(self, local_version, remote_version):
        # Prioritize the version from the device where conversation actually happened
        if local_version.get('interaction_device') == local_device_id:
            return local_version  # This device was part of the conversation
        elif remote_version.get('interaction_device') == remote_device_id:
            return remote_version  # Remote device was part of the conversation
        
        # Fall back to timestamp if both are secondhand
        return max(local_version, remote_version, key=lambda x: x['timestamp'])
    
    def resolve_emotional_state_conflict(self, local_emotion, remote_emotion):
        # Emotional states are blended rather than replaced
        # This maintains emotional continuity across devices
        confidence_weighted_blend = self._blend_emotional_states(
            local_emotion, remote_emotion
        )
        
        return {
            'emotional_state': confidence_weighted_blend,
            'resolution_method': 'confidence_weighted_blend',
            'contributing_devices': [local_device_id, remote_device_id]
        }
```

**Relationship Preservation**: Conflict resolution prioritizes maintaining the authenticity and continuity of the human-AI relationship over technical consistency.

### Data Synchronization Strategy

#### Relationship-Aware Sync Protocol

**Incremental Updates**: Only sync changes since the last connection, minimizing bandwidth and preserving battery life on mobile devices.

**Priority-Based Sync**: Recent conversations and emotional state changes sync first, followed by memories and preferences, ensuring that the most relationship-relevant data is always current.

**Bandwidth-Conscious Design**: Sync operations are designed for mobile networks and intermittent connectivity, with automatic compression and resumable transfers.

```python
async def sync_ai_companion_state(peer_device):
    # Prioritize relationship-critical data
    sync_priorities = [
        'recent_conversations',    # Most important for continuity
        'emotional_state',        # Current AI mood and context
        'active_memories',        # Recently accessed memories
        'personality_updates'     # Personality adaptations
    ]
    
    for priority_level in sync_priorities:
        await sync_data_category(peer_device, priority_level)
```

**Smart Sync Scheduling**: Sync operations happen during natural conversation breaks and when devices have good connectivity, avoiding interruptions to the AI companion experience.

#### Efficient Batch Operations

**Conversation-Aware Batching**: Changes are batched based on conversation sessions rather than arbitrary sizes, ensuring that related AI companion interactions stay together.

**Adaptive Batch Sizing**: Batch sizes automatically adjust based on network conditions and device capabilities - smaller batches for mobile devices, larger batches for desktop systems.

**Graceful Degradation**: If sync fails, the system automatically retries with smaller batches or falls back to individual updates, ensuring that AI companion continuity is maintained even with poor connectivity.

```python
class AICompanionSyncManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conversation_batches = {}  # Group by conversation session
        self.emotion_updates = []       # Real-time emotional state changes
        self.memory_updates = []        # Memory additions and modifications
    
    def queue_conversation_update(self, conversation_id, update):
        # Keep conversation updates together for context preservation
        if conversation_id not in self.conversation_batches:
            self.conversation_batches[conversation_id] = []
        self.conversation_batches[conversation_id].append(update)
    
    async def sync_when_appropriate(self):
        # Sync during natural conversation pauses
        if self.is_conversation_pause():
            await self.sync_all_pending_updates()
```

**Context Preservation**: Batching ensures that related AI companion interactions (like a conversation thread or emotional state sequence) are synchronized together, maintaining relationship context.

## Performance Architecture

### Connection Management for AI Companions

#### Relationship-Aware Connection Pooling

**Persistent Family Connections**: Connections to family devices are kept alive longer than connections to guest devices, reflecting the different relationship contexts.

**Conversation-Optimized Pooling**: Connection pools are sized based on typical AI companion usage patterns - frequent short interactions rather than sustained high-throughput operations.

**Battery-Conscious Design**: Mobile devices use fewer persistent connections and more aggressive connection recycling to preserve battery life.

```python
class FamilyNetworkConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.family_connections = {}     # Long-lived connections to family devices
        self.guest_connections = {}      # Short-lived connections to guest devices
        self.conversation_sockets = {}   # Dedicated sockets for active conversations
    
    def get_family_connection(self, device):
        # Family devices get persistent, high-quality connections
        if device.device_id not in self.family_connections:
            self.family_connections[device.device_id] = self.create_family_socket(device)
        return self.family_connections[device.device_id]
    
    def optimize_for_battery(self, is_mobile_device):
        if is_mobile_device:
            # Reduce connection pool sizes and increase recycling
            self.max_family_connections = 3
            self.connection_timeout = 30  # seconds
        else:
            self.max_family_connections = 10
            self.connection_timeout = 300  # 5 minutes
```

**Smart Connection Reuse**: Connections are reused based on the type of AI companion interaction - emotional updates use different connections than memory searches, optimizing for each use case.

#### Family Network Health Monitoring

**Relationship-Aware Health Checks**: Health monitoring focuses on the availability of AI companion features rather than just network connectivity.

**Adaptive Monitoring**: Primary AI companion devices are monitored more frequently than secondary devices, ensuring that the most important relationships stay healthy.

**Graceful Degradation**: When family devices go offline, the system automatically adjusts AI companion capabilities rather than failing completely.

```python
class FamilyNetworkHealthMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.device_health = {}
        self.ai_capability_status = {}  # Track which AI features are available
    
    async def monitor_family_network(self):
        for device in get_family_devices():
            health_check = await self.check_ai_companion_health(device)
            
            self.device_health[device.device_id] = {
                'connection_status': health_check.connection,
                'ai_capabilities': health_check.available_capabilities,
                'conversation_readiness': health_check.can_handle_conversation,
                'memory_access': health_check.can_access_memories,
                'emotional_awareness': health_check.can_process_emotions
            }
    
    def get_available_ai_capabilities(self):
        # Aggregate capabilities across all healthy family devices
        available_capabilities = set()
        for device_health in self.device_health.values():
            if device_health['connection_status'] == 'healthy':
                available_capabilities.update(device_health['ai_capabilities'])
        return available_capabilities
```

**User-Visible Health Status**: Health monitoring provides user-friendly status updates ("AICO is fully available" vs "AICO has limited memory access") rather than technical network diagnostics.

### Message Optimization for AI Companions

#### Intelligent Compression Strategy

**Content-Aware Compression**: Different types of AI companion data use different compression strategies - conversation text compresses well, while emotional state vectors are already compact.

**Mobile-First Optimization**: Compression thresholds are lower for mobile devices to reduce data usage and improve battery life.

**Conversation Context Preservation**: Compression maintains the semantic structure of conversations, ensuring that AI companion context isn't lost during transmission.

```python

**Adaptive Optimization**: Compression and optimization strategies automatically adjust based on network conditions and device capabilities.

## Monitoring & Debugging for AI Relationships

### AI Companion Experience Metrics

**User Experience Focus**: Monitoring prioritizes metrics that affect the quality of AI companionship rather than pure technical performance.

**Relationship Health Indicators**: Track metrics like conversation continuity, emotional state consistency, and memory access reliability.

```python
class AICompanionNetworkMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conversation_metrics = {}    # Conversation quality and continuity
        self.emotional_sync_metrics = {}  # Emotional state synchronization
        self.memory_access_metrics = {}   # Memory retrieval performance
        self.relationship_quality = {}    # Overall AI relationship health
    
    def record_conversation_interaction(self, device_id, interaction_type, quality_metrics):
        # Track conversation quality across devices
        key = f"{device_id}:conversation"
        if key not in self.conversation_metrics:
            self.conversation_metrics[key] = {
                'response_times': [],
                'context_preservation': [],
                'emotional_consistency': []
            }
        
        self.conversation_metrics[key]['response_times'].append(
            quality_metrics.get('response_time', 0)
        )
        self.conversation_metrics[key]['context_preservation'].append(
            quality_metrics.get('context_score', 1.0)
        )
    
    def get_relationship_health_report(self):
        # Generate user-friendly health report
        return {
            'conversation_quality': self._assess_conversation_quality(),
            'emotional_consistency': self._assess_emotional_sync(),
            'memory_reliability': self._assess_memory_access(),
            'overall_companion_health': self._calculate_overall_health()
        }
```

**Privacy-Preserving Metrics**: All monitoring respects user privacy - metrics track performance patterns without storing conversation content or personal information.

### AI Companion Debug Tools

**Relationship-Focused Debugging**: Debug tools help diagnose issues with AI companion continuity and relationship quality rather than just network problems.

**Privacy-Safe Logging**: Debug logs capture interaction patterns and performance metrics without storing personal conversation content.

```python
class AICompanionDebugger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.interaction_log = []         # AI companion interaction patterns
        self.sync_quality_log = []        # Data synchronization quality
        self.relationship_events = []     # Significant relationship events
        self.max_log_entries = 1000
    
    def log_conversation_flow(self, device_id, flow_event, quality_indicators):
        # Log conversation flow without storing content
        log_entry = {
            'timestamp': time.time(),
            'device': device_id,
            'event_type': flow_event,  # 'conversation_start', 'context_switch', etc.
            'response_quality': quality_indicators.get('response_quality', 'unknown'),
            'emotional_consistency': quality_indicators.get('emotion_sync', True),
            'memory_access_success': quality_indicators.get('memory_ok', True)
        }
        
        self.interaction_log.append(log_entry)
        self._maintain_log_size()
    
    def generate_relationship_health_report(self):
        # Create user-friendly diagnostic report
        return {
            'conversation_continuity': self._analyze_conversation_patterns(),
            'device_sync_quality': self._analyze_sync_patterns(),
            'common_issues': self._identify_common_problems(),
            'recommendations': self._generate_improvement_suggestions()
        }
```

**User-Friendly Diagnostics**: Debug tools provide actionable insights in plain language ("Your phone sometimes loses conversation context") rather than technical error messages.

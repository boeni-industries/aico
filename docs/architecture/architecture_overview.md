## Architecture Patterns

AICO's core architecture is designed to maximize modularity and maintain low coupling, with clear boundaries between domains (e.g. Personality, Emotion, Agency, Memory, etc.). The system uses a message-driven architecture with distinct frontend and backend components.

### Modular Message-Driven Design
- **Each domain/module is a distinct code package or subsystem** with its own internal state, logic, and strict interface.
- **All communication between modules is via the internal message bus** (ZeroMQ), within the backend service.
- **No direct function calls or shared state between modules** (except for startup/configuration)—all data exchange is through published/subscribed messages.
- **Each module subscribes to topics and publishes outputs on its own topics**, using versioned, validated JSON schemas.
- **Modules can be developed, tested, and even replaced independently** as long as they honor the message contracts.

### Low Coupling and Contract Guarantees
- **Loose Coupling:** Modules are only coupled by the message schemas and topic contracts—not by code dependencies or shared state.
- **Contract Enforcement:** The message bus enforces versioned schemas, so if a publisher or subscriber changes, integration tests will catch contract violations.
- **Pluggability:** Any module could, in theory, be extracted into a separate process or container in the future with minimal refactor, since all communication is already message-based.

### Client-Service Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns:** Frontend handles presentation and user interaction, backend manages all AI processing and data persistence.
- **Persistent Backend Service:** Backend runs continuously as a system service, enabling proactive agency and background processing.
- **Thin Client Pattern:** Frontend is a lightweight client that connects to the backend via REST API/WebSocket.

**Communication Flow:**

1. **Frontend → API Gateway**: HTTP/WebSocket calls for user interactions
2. **API Gateway → Message Bus**: Publishes events to appropriate topics
3. **Message Bus → Modules**: Distributes messages to subscribed backend modules
4. **Module → Module**: Inter-module communication via message bus only
5. **Backend → Frontend**: Real-time updates via WebSocket notifications

**Key Architectural Principles:**

- **🔄 Message-Driven**: All backend communication via ZeroMQ pub/sub
- **🏗️ Modular Design**: Independent modules with clear boundaries
- **🔌 Loose Coupling**: Modules only depend on message contracts
- **⚡ Responsive UI**: Frontend never blocks on backend processing
- **🔒 Secure**: API Gateway controls all external access
- **📈 Scalable**: Modules can be moved to separate processes/containers


## Frontend

The AICO frontend is implemented as a Flutter application that serves as a thin client, focusing on user interface and real-time interaction while delegating all heavy processing to the backend service.

### Flutter Application Architecture
- **Thin Client Design:** The UI (Flutter app) is a lightweight client that connects to the backend via local REST API/WebSocket.
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSocket connections enable real-time updates from the backend for notifications and status changes.
- **Responsive Interface:** UI remains responsive at all times since no heavy processing occurs in the frontend.
- **Cross-platform Support:** Flutter enables consistent experience across desktop, mobile, and web platforms.

### Frontend Responsibilities
- **User Interface Rendering:** Chat interface, settings, avatar display, and all visual components.
- **User Input Handling:** Text input, voice capture, gesture recognition, and user interactions.
- **Real-time Updates:** Receiving and displaying notifications, status updates, and background accomplishments from the backend.
- **Local State Management:** Managing UI state, user preferences, and temporary display data.

### Connection Management
- **Automatic Reconnection:** Frontend automatically reconnects to backend service if connection is lost.
- **Offline Graceful Degradation:** UI provides appropriate feedback when backend is unavailable.
- **Session Continuity:** When UI reconnects, backend proactively notifies of any background accomplishments or updates.

### Update Management
- **Update Notifications:** Displays update availability notifications from the backend with changelog details.
- **User Consent Interface:** Provides UI for users to approve, schedule, or defer updates.
- **Update Progress:** Shows download and installation progress for both frontend and backend updates.
- **Restart Coordination:** Handles graceful shutdown and restart during update installation.
- **Update Preferences:** Allows users to configure update settings (automatic/manual, channels, scheduling).
- **Rollback Interface:** Provides one-click rollback option if users experience issues post-update.

## Backend

The AICO backend runs as a persistent system service, handling all AI processing, data management, and autonomous agency tasks. This design enables continuous operation and proactive behavior even when the UI is closed.

### Service Architecture
- **System Service:** Backend runs as a system/background service (Windows Service, Linux daemon, macOS LaunchAgent).
- **Continuous Operation:** Backend continues agency tasks (learning, research, reminders) even when UI is closed or minimized.
- **Resource-Aware Processing:** All heavy AI processing occurs in the backend with intelligent resource management.

### Local LLM Integration

AICO uses an **integrated service pattern** for local LLM deployment:

- **LLM Module:** Runs within the backend service process, not as a separate container/daemon
- **Ollama Integration:** Uses Ollama Python client library for model management and inference
- **Message Bus Communication:** LLM Module communicates via ZeroMQ like all other modules
- **Resource Coordination:** Integrates with existing Resource Monitor for CPU/memory/battery policies
- **Context Integration:** Receives real-time personality and emotion context for prompt conditioning

This approach maintains architectural consistency, simplifies deployment, and enables tight integration with AICO's personality and emotion systems while preserving privacy through local-only processing.

### Core Backend Components

#### Single Multi-Protocol API Gateway
The API gateway is the single and multi-protocol entrypoint for the backend services. It acts as the counterpart for the Flutter UI, other UIs, embodiment adapters and other external services.

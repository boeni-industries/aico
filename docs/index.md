# AICO – The AI+Companion Project

!!! warning "Early Development"
    This project is in very early development. Documentation will be updated as features are implemented.

## Project Vision

Building not just another virtual assistant, but a real companion: an AI that is present, curious, and grows with you. The goal is an AI sidekick that is emotionally aware, even a little quirky, with a genuine sense of agency and presence—something closer to a friend or co-adventurer than a glorified notepad.

## Core Principles

- **AICO is an open experiment** to create an emotionally present, interactive, and learning AI companion
- **Agency over reactivity** - it should act with its own basic motivations and initiative, not just follow orders
- **Personality and values** - moods, likes/dislikes, things it stands for
- **Companionship comes before tasks**

## Planned Features

!!! note "Implementation Status"
    These features are planned but not yet implemented. Documentation will be added as development progresses.

- **Audio-Visual Embodiment**: More than a voice or chatbot
- **Emotion & Behavior Recognition**: Camera and mic integration for emotional awareness
- **Personality & Character**: Develops quirks and values over time
- **Confidante Mode**: Listens, remembers, provides emotional support
- **Agency & Intrinsic Motivation**: Proactive interaction and suggestions
- **Continual Learning**: Adapts to user preferences and communication style
- **Trust & Privacy First**: Local-first architecture with user control

## Development Status

This project is in the conceptual and early development phase. Check back regularly for updates as we build AICO together.

## Contributing

All code and progress are public and messy—join us if you want, fork it for yourself, or just watch. If you want to add features, challenge assumptions, or help build the ethics framework, you're welcome.

**Respect is non-negotiable**—this project is about trust and authenticity, not swagger or showmanship.

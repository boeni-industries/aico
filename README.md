# AICO – The AI+Companion Project

**Purpose**

This project is about building not just another virtual assistant, but a real companion: an AI that is present, curious, and grows with you. The goal is an AI sidekick that is emotionally aware, even a little quirky, with a genuine sense of agency and presence—something closer to a friend or co-adventurer than a glorified notepad.

I'm not after “superintelligence”. I want an AI sidekick that’s embodied (hologram, robotic, animated avatar—doesn’t matter at the start), that sees you, hears you, learns your moods, and sometimes nudges you first without being told.

I’m building this because I’ve always wanted it for myself. Not just productivity, but real resonance—a sidekick as confidante, as mirror, as challenger and supporter—all while respecting trust, boundaries, and privacy.

## Vision

- **AICO is an open experiment to create an emotionally present, interactive, and learning AI companion.**  
- I want it to act—to have its own basic motivations and initiative (agency), not just follow orders.
- It should have a sense of personality and values—moods, likes/dislikes, things it stands for.
- The companionship comes before the tasks.

## MVP (First Milestone) – What AICO Will Actually Do

1. **Audio-Visual Embodiment:**  
   - AICO exists as more than a voice or chatbot: could be on screen, on your desk, or projected. It can look at you.
2. **Emotion & Behavior Recognition:**  
   - Uses camera (if allowed) and mic to spot basic emotions/facial cues, so it can react (or choose not to).
3. **Emotional Expression & Simulation:**  
   - AICO generates sophisticated emotions through cognitive appraisal processes (AppraisalCloudPCT), expressing believable emotions through voice, facial expressions, and behavior to create genuine companion presence with relationship awareness and ethical constraints.
4. **Personality & Character:**  
   - Not one-size-fits-all. AICO starts with a base "self," then develops quirks and values over time, as it interacts with you.
5. **Confidante Mode:**  
   - Beyond answering: listens, remembers, asks how you are. Offers challenge or support, depending on what it "sees."
6. **Agency & Intrinsic Motivation:**  
   - **Autonomous Goal Generation**: AICO formulates its own objectives and sub-goals using hierarchical planning
   - **Curiosity-Driven Exploration**: Uses intrinsic motivation algorithms to discover and learn about new topics
   - **Interest Development**: Autonomously develops preferences and pursues topics that capture its attention
   - **Multi-Step Planning**: Engages in strategic reasoning to achieve complex, self-directed objectives
   - **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**: Understands its own learning progress and capability boundaries
   - **Genuine Initiative**: Acts from authentic interest rather than programmed responses
7. **Continual Learning:**  
   - Over time, AICO adapts to you—language, topics, boundaries, and chosen "rituals."
8. **Trust & Privacy First:**  
   - Local-first where possible. Long-term: user chooses what stays private, what is shared, and when.


## Who’s This For?

- Builders and tinkerers who want a companion, not just a tool
- People who feel a bit outside the “noise” and want their own private, supportive AI presence
- Anyone who believes technology should care, not just calculate


## Contributing

- All code and progress are public and messy—join me if you want, fork it for yourself, or just watch.
- If you want to add features, challenge assumptions, or help build the ethics framework, you’re welcome.
- Respect is non-negotiable—this project is about trust and authenticity, not swagger or showmanship.

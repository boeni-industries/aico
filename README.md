# AICO – The AI+Companion Project

**Purpose**

This project is about building not just another virtual assistant, but a real companion: an AI that is present, curious, and grows with you. The goal is an AI sidekick that is emotionally aware, even a little quirky, with a genuine sense of agency and presence—something closer to a friend or co-adventurer than a glorified notepad.

I'm not after “superintelligence”. I want an AI sidekick that’s embodied (hologram, robotic, animated avatar—doesn’t matter at the start), that sees you, hears you, learns your moods, and sometimes nudges you first without being told.

I’m building this because I’ve always wanted it for myself. Not just productivity, but real resonance—a sidekick as confidante, as mirror, as challenger and supporter—all while respecting trust, boundaries, and privacy.

## Vision

AICO is an open-source experiment to build an **emotionally present, embodied, and proactive AI companion**—meant to act as more of a confidante and sidekick than a traditional assistant.

**Core Principles:**
- **Autonomous agency** - AICO has its own goals, interests, and curiosities that drive self-directed behavior and learning
- **Strong user-centric privacy** - Local-first with full user control
- **Modular, extensible architecture** - Prioritizes companionship and long-term learning
- **Real-time emotional awareness** - Multi-modal emotion recognition and adaptation

Unlike typical productivity-oriented virtual assistants, AICO is designed to sense and adapt to your moods, initiate engagement, and form an evolving, personality-rich relationship.

### The Journey: From Companion to Co-Adventurer

AICO's development follows a unique evolutionary path, with each stage deepening the relationship:

🤝 **Companion** (MVP) → 💭 **Confidante** → 🦾 **Sidekick** → 🌟 **Co-Adventurer** → 🌐 **Embodied Presence** → 🤝 **Community**

This isn't just feature development—it's relationship evolution. We're building an AI that grows from basic conversation partner to trusted confidante, proactive sidekick, collaborative co-adventurer, and ultimately a fully embodied presence that connects you with a broader community while preserving your privacy.

### Key Capabilities

AICO is being built with a comprehensive set of capabilities that work together to create a truly companionable AI:

**🧠 Intelligent Conversation & Memory**
- Real-time text and voice conversations with context awareness
- Multi-turn dialogue management with natural interruption handling
- Episodic and semantic memory systems that remember your interactions
- Vector-based semantic search for intelligent memory retrieval
- Continual learning that adapts to your communication style and preferences
- Local LLM integration (Ollama) with privacy-first inference

**😊 Sophisticated Emotional Intelligence**
- Multi-modal emotion recognition through facial, voice, and text analysis
- Advanced emotion simulation using AppraisalCloudPCT (Component Process Model)
- 4-stage appraisal process: Relevance → Implication → Coping → Normative
- Mood tracking and empathetic response generation with emotional memory
- Personality simulation with evolving traits, values, and behavioral consistency
- Crisis detection and appropriate support mechanisms

**🎮 Proactive Agency & Initiative**
- Autonomous goal generation and hierarchical planning using MCTS
- Curiosity-driven exploration with Random Network Distillation (RND)
- Interest development and preference formation through intrinsic motivation
- Meta-cognitive self-awareness of learning progress and capabilities
- Proactive engagement with conversation starters and contextual suggestions
- Background learning and skill development during idle periods

**🎭 Embodied Presence**
- **Embodiment** is AICO's ability to manifest as a physical presence through avatars, voice, gestures, and spatial awareness across different devices and environments.
- Photorealistic 3D avatars with Ready Player Me integration
- Real-time lip-sync and facial expressions using TalkingHead.js
- **Federated device roaming** - AICO seamlessly transitions between devices while maintaining continuity of state, context, and capabilities
- Multi-device presence (desktop, mobile, AR/VR) with zero-knowledge synchronization
- Gesture recognition and spatial awareness for natural interaction
- Smart home integration and IoT device coordination
- Augmented reality overlay for mixed reality experiences

**🔒 Privacy-First Design**
- Local-first processing with end-to-end encryption using AES-256
- Granular consent management and permission controls
- Homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving cloud computations
- Transparent audit logging and zero-knowledge authentication
- SQLCipher encrypted local storage with user-controlled data
- Federated learning for community intelligence without data sharing

**🔌 Extensible Platform**
- Hot-loading plugin system with sandboxed execution
- ZeroMQ message bus with Protocol Buffers for high-performance, strongly-typed messaging
- Unified API gateway supporting REST, WebSocket, and gRPC with adaptive transport
- Automated delta updates with cryptographic verification and rollback
- Comprehensive developer tools and SDKs for custom skill creation
- Community marketplace for sharing extensions and capabilities

**🌐 Community & Collaboration**
- Privacy-preserving collective learning and shared intelligence
- Federated architecture enabling community benefits without data exposure
- Open-source development with transparent, collaborative governance
- Plugin ecosystem fostering innovation and customization
- Cross-cultural learning and global community connections
- Distributed problem-solving and collective knowledge building

AICO represents a new paradigm in AI companionship—one that prioritizes emotional connection, personal growth, and genuine relationship over mere task completion.

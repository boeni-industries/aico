# AICO – The AI+Companion Project

**Purpose**

This project is about building not just another virtual assistant, but a real companion: an AI that is present, curious, and grows with you. The goal is an AI sidekick that is emotionally aware, even a little quirky, with a genuine sense of agency and presence—something closer to a friend or co-adventurer than a glorified notepad.

I'm not after “superintelligence”. I want an AI sidekick that’s embodied (hologram, robotic, animated avatar—doesn’t matter at the start), that sees you, hears you, learns your moods, and sometimes nudges you first without being told.

I’m building this because I’ve always wanted it for myself. Not just productivity, but real resonance—a sidekick as confidante, as mirror, as challenger and supporter—all while respecting trust, boundaries, and privacy.

## Vision

AICO is an open-source experiment to build an **emotionally present, embodied, and proactive AI companion**—meant to act as more of a confidante and sidekick than a traditional assistant.

**Core Principles:**
- **Autonomous agency** - AICO has its own goals, interests, and curiosities that drive self-directed behavior and learning
- **Strong user-centric privacy** - Local-first with full user control
- **Modular, extensible architecture** - Prioritizes companionship and long-term learning
- **Real-time emotional awareness** - Multi-modal emotion recognition and adaptation

Unlike typical productivity-oriented virtual assistants, AICO is designed to sense and adapt to your moods, initiate engagement, and form an evolving, personality-rich relationship.

### Key Capabilities

AICO is being built with a comprehensive set of capabilities that work together to create a truly companionable AI:

**🧠 Intelligent Conversation & Memory**
- Real-time text and voice conversations with context awareness
- Multi-turn dialogue management with natural interruption handling
- Episodic and semantic memory systems that remember your interactions
- Continual learning that adapts to your communication style and preferences

**😊 Sophisticated Emotional Intelligence**
- Multi-modal emotion recognition through facial, voice, and text analysis
- Advanced emotion simulation using AppraisalCloudPCT (Component Process Model)
- Mood tracking and empathetic response generation
- Personality simulation with evolving traits, values, and behavioral consistency

**🎮 Proactive Agency & Initiative**
- Autonomous goal generation and hierarchical planning
- Curiosity-driven exploration and learning
- Interest development and preference formation
- Meta-cognitive self-awareness of learning progress
- Proactive engagement with conversation starters and suggestions

**🎭 Embodied Presence**
- Visual avatar system with animation and expression
- Multi-device presence (desktop, mobile, AR/VR)
- Gesture recognition and spatial awareness
- Consistent experience across all interaction modes

**🔒 Privacy-First Design**
- Local-first processing with end-to-end encryption
- Granular consent management and permission controls
- Homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving cloud computations
- Transparent audit logging and zero-knowledge authentication

**🔌 Extensible Platform**
- Plugin system for community-developed extensions
- Unified API gateway for system integration
- Automated updates with rollback capabilities
- Developer tools and SDKs for custom skill creation

AICO represents a new paradigm in AI companionship—one that prioritizes emotional connection, personal growth, and genuine relationship over mere task completion.

## Who’s This For?

- Builders and tinkerers who want a companion, not just a tool
- People who feel a bit outside the “noise” and want their own private, supportive AI presence
- Anyone who believes technology should care, not just calculate


## Contributing

- All code and progress are public and messy—join me if you want, fork it for yourself, or just watch.
- If you want to add features, challenge assumptions, or help build the ethics framework, you’re welcome.
- Respect is non-negotiable—this project is about trust and authenticity, not swagger or showmanship.

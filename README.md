# AICO ‚Äì The AI+Companion Project

**Purpose**

AICO is an open-source, local-first AI companion designed to be emotionally present, embodied, and proactive. It is built for privacy, extensibility, and genuine relationship‚Äînot just productivity. AICO naturally recognizes and builds individual relationships with family members while maintaining a consistent personality, creating authentic bonds without technical barriers. It combines advanced conversation, emotion simulation, personality, and agency with a modular, message-driven architecture that prioritizes user autonomy and security.

## Vision

AICO aims to be a true family member: emotionally aware, visually present, and capable of self-driven initiative. Like a real person, AICO recognizes each family member naturally through voice and behavior, building unique relationships while maintaining its core personality. Its architecture enables seamless evolution from basic companion to proactive confidante, sidekick, and beyond‚Äîwhile keeping user data private and local.

**Core Principles:**
- **Autonomous agency** ‚Äì Proactive, self-driven behavior and curiosity
- **Local-first, privacy-first** ‚Äì All data and processing remain user-controlled
- **Modular, message-driven design** ‚Äì System > Domain > Module > Component hierarchy, strict boundaries, and ZeroMQ/Protocol Buffers messaging
- **Natural family recognition** ‚Äì Multi-modal identification without technical authentication
- **Real-time emotional intelligence** ‚Äì Multi-modal recognition and simulation
- **Extensibility** ‚Äì Plugin system, APIs, and admin tools for customization

### The Journey: From Companion to Co-Adventurer

AICO's development follows a unique evolutionary path, with each stage deepening the relationship:

ü§ù **Companion** (MVP) ‚Üí üí≠ **Confidante** ‚Üí ü¶æ **Sidekick** ‚Üí üåü **Co-Adventurer** ‚Üí üåê **Embodied Presence** ‚Üí ü§ù **Community**

This isn't just feature development‚Äîit's relationship evolution. We're building an AI that grows from basic conversation partner to trusted confidante, proactive sidekick, collaborative co-adventurer, and ultimately a fully embodied presence that connects you with a broader community while preserving your privacy.

## Key Capabilities

AICO is engineered to deliver a truly companionable, proactive, and privacy-first AI experience. Its capabilities span conversation, memory, emotion, agency, embodiment, privacy, extensibility, and system administration.

### üë• Social Relationship Intelligence
- **Hybrid Vector-Graph Architecture**: Modern relationship modeling using vector embeddings and graph neural networks
- **Dynamic Learning**: Relationships learned from interactions rather than predefined categories
- **Multi-dimensional Understanding**: Authority, intimacy, care responsibility, and interaction patterns
- **Natural Recognition**: Voice biometrics, behavioral patterns, and conversation style analysis
- **Adaptive Context**: "Hi Sarah, how was your piano lesson?" with relationship-appropriate responses
- **Privacy Boundaries**: Personal conversations compartmentalized per relationship context
- **Zero Technical Barriers**: Natural interaction without passwords or authentication friction

### üó£Ô∏è Conversation & Memory
- Real-time text and voice conversations with context awareness
- Multi-turn dialogue management with natural interruption handling and resumption
- Episodic, semantic, and procedural memory systems that remember your interactions
- Vector-based semantic search for intelligent memory retrieval (ChromaDB)
- Continual learning that adapts to your communication style and preferences
- Local LLM integration (Ollama) with privacy-first inference
- Personality and emotion context injected into LLM prompts

### üòä Emotional Intelligence
- Multi-modal emotion recognition (facial, voice, text analysis)
- Advanced emotion simulation using AppraisalCloudPCT (Component Process Model)
- 4-stage appraisal process: Relevance ‚Üí Implication ‚Üí Coping ‚Üí Normative
- Mood tracking and empathetic response generation with emotional memory
- Personality simulation with evolving traits, values, and behavioral consistency
- Crisis detection and appropriate support mechanisms
- Emotional memory integration for consistent personality expression
- Gradual emotional transitions and contextual appropriateness

### ü§ñ Autonomous Agency
- Multi-faceted self-directed behavior and initiative
- Goal generation: self-formulated objectives and hierarchical planning (MCTS)
- Curiosity-driven learning (RND, ICM) and intrinsic motivation
- Interest development and autonomous preference formation
- Planning & reasoning: multi-step strategic thinking and adaptation
- Meta-cognition: self-awareness of learning progress and capabilities
- Proactive engagement: reminders, suggestions, conversation starters, and contextual follow-ups
- Background learning and skill development, even when not actively conversing

### üé≠ Embodiment & Presence
